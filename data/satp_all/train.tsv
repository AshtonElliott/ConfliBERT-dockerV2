He said that, in 2009, the then President of Sri Lanka had made a promise to Ban Ki moon that the Government would undertake to ensure the welfare of the Tamil people in future. It is good to examine whether the present government has honoured these pledges. Another pact had been signed in Geneva and it is relevant to examine whether what was contained in that pact for the betterment of the Tamil people has been implemented. A third describes how our country should change by 2030 and what should be done for the people.

Joint Commissioner of Police (law and order) Sanjeev Kumar Singhal said that during the last few months some Police Stations had received anonymous letters warning about terror attacks in the city.

We make the best possible efforts to identify the source sending such letters even if they are hoaxes, he said.

If we are not compelled to use our forces within the mainland they can be engaged at the borders, he said. He took a stock of the situation prevailing in all ten states which includes Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh considered to be red corridor region of the country. Our Central Minister Rajnath Singh has agreed to extend full cooperation in terms of financial support and assistance of the security forces in these states to ensure that the development work is not affected, he said.

Construction of schools, health centres, railway, industry, irrigation projects and roads have also suffered because of presence of Maoists which has not just retarded government s effort for development but has deprived the tribals of facilities that they should enjoy as citizens of an independent nation, he said underlining the fact that everyone in the country has equal right to life and opportunities.	0	0	0	0

While talking to British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Urdu, Shahbaz revealed that he was with IMU until the group fought with Afghan Taliban on the dispute over allegiance as IMU did not consider Khilafah established by Afghan Taliban as legitimate and wanted to ally with the self styled Islamic State (IS).They abducted me from Lahore and took me to Waziristan s Meer Ali area and used to shift my location every month from there, said Shahbaz. He claimed that when Uzbeks attacked Karachi airport he was there in Meer Ali, but as they knew how Pakistan s government and army will respond, they shifted him to Dattakhel where he stayed there till February 2015. Following the dispute, Afghan Taliban attacked the Uzbeks and eliminated their whole group — their leadership. For three days, only death lived there. At that time I got an opportunity to escape and did so, but Afghan Taliban took me for an Uzbek and captured me. I was kept with other prisoners and then they took us to a village where a judge came and awarded sentences from 6 months to 2 years and we were sent to an Afghan jail. There I met a fellow Taliban prisoner who helped my release, it took him two to three months but he paved the way for my release said Taseer.	0	0	0	0

According to a report published in the latest edition of the Combating Terrorism Exchange (CTX) journal, radical Islamist group Hizb ut Tahrir (HuT), which cleverly avoided global scrutiny while spreading its ideology, may become a more dangerous terrorist group than the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its presence in South Asia should be a cause for concern for India, reports The Asian Age on February 19. The report said that “While ISIS runs amok in Syria and Iraq, demanding media attention through acts of barbarous cruelty, HuT (the Party of Liberation) is quietly building a global infrastructure of radicalised youth and deep pocketed Arab support in preparation for the global Khilafat,” The terrorist group has cleverly avoided any intense global scrutiny while spreading its ideology and support base in nearly 50 countries, said the report. The group commands a base of over one million members worldwide. This is far higher than what ISIS claims to have. The report also said HuT has an armed wing called Harakat ul Muhojirinfi Britaniya that is training its cadres in chemical, bacteriological, and biological warfare. Founded in Jerusalem in 1952 and headquartered in London, the group has branches in Central Asia, Europe, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, where it has managed to garner great influence. In South Asia, HuT has a significant presence in Pakistan and Bangladesh. “Although HuT has reportedly found a foothold in India, its presence and influence have not made any significant impact,” said the multimedia journal on strategic and security affairs. “HuT’s growing presence in neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan should be a cause of concern for India and the larger global community,” it said. On its website, HuT claimed that it had organised a demonstration in 2010 at Batla House in Delhi in protest against Israel’s alleged atrocities. The demonstration, which was attended by about 1,000 people, was HuT’s last reported activity in India, said the report prepared by Surinder Kumar Sharma, who is associated with Delhi based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA).	0	0	0	0

Questioning of the arrested cadres revealed they were befriending gunrunners in Nagaland and Myanmar. Police teams had recovered eight handmade AK 47 lookalike rifles in a raid earlier. Bura Bhai (already arrested) and two others from West Bengal were imparting arms and physical training to recruits at Daukhanagar and Amguri camps. The AK series rifles were bought for this purpose from the Nagaland side. Besides, some local clandestine arms makers are also helping with a few handmade arms, sources said. The two cadres from the neighbouring state of West Bengal are now on the run, along with seven other suspected members of a jihadi module.Earlier, BTAD Inspector General of Police (IGP) LR Bishnoi said the module follows the same training programme as that of the Jamat ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). Though State Police have not commented officially on the possible nexus between this module and other militant outfits of the region, sources said some gunrunners in the Barak Valley are helping these modules get access to the clandestine arms market in Myanmar. Illegal arms allegedly enter the country through the borders of Nagaland and Manipur from Myanmar. These travel to Assam through Dimapur and reach rebels in the state and in Meghalaya. In recent years, Assam has witnessed a steep rise in cases registered under the Arms Act. Official records point out that, 492 cases had been registered under the Arms Act in the State in 2010.

Pakistan based Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) outfit runs a series of well oiled courses for budding terrorists, ranging from religious indoctrination to military and intelligence training, which are aimed at boosting militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, reports Times of India. David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani American LeT operative and an accused in the 26 11, in his testimony during the recently concluded trial of co accused Tahawwur Rana provided an insight into the religious, military and intelligence training being imparted by the LeT. He told the court that he went for religious training by the LeT in 2002 the three month operational military training in 2003 and the LeT leadership course in 2004. In between, he did a course in intelligence in 2003. I did the basic the religious course in the beginning. I did a preliminary course, a military. And then I did the advanced course. Then I did the intelligence course. Then I did the anti terrorist course. Then I did the leadership course. And that s it, Headley told the court in response to a question from the defence attorney. All these courses, he said, were directed towards fighting in Jammu and Kashmir. Headley told the court that LeT taught them small unit tactics, for conventional and guerrilla warfare in both urban and country settings, so that LeT terrorists could fight against the Indian Army. And that was your aim, that you were going to fight in that battle he was asked. That is correct , Headley responded. They really didn t teach you ...in the intelligence course, the intelligence was designed to help you with that type of a battle, correct, fighting in the guerrilla war, so to speak he was asked. No. The intelligence was a little different from that. That was geared toward living... small groups of Lashkar operatives that would go in and live inside of India. That was geared for that mainly, Headley said. Small groups. Where were they going to live, in Kashmir or India itself the defence attorney asked. In India or Kashmir, both, Headley said. And do what type of work he was asked. Surveillance or checking out some locations as well as VIPs or personnel, he said. After working for LeT for four five years, Major Iqbal of the Pakistan’s external intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), got in touch with him in 2006. How do you know he was in ISI the defence attorney asked. Because I had been introduced to him by a person who had met—who I had met inside a military cantonment in Landi Kotal, Headley said.	0	0	0	0

The forensic report will help establish Pakistans complicity and serve as crucial evidence in a court of law. Jundal has told the Police it was his idea to give fake college identity cards (ID) to the ten 26 11 terrorists, as reported on July 26, by The Times of India.

AP Police, which filed a reply in the High Court, in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) submitted by Civil Liberties Committee, said that the incident of firing took place outside of the territory of AP, in Odisha. In the reply, Visakhapatnam Rural District Superintendent of Police (SP) Rahul Dev Sharma said that on October 24, they got information about the presence of Maoists in the AOB (Andhra Odisha Border) and Police parties of Odisha and AP reached the forest area of Ramagurah . On seeing the police parties, the Maoists, who were armed with latest automatic weapons, opened fire on the police parties resulting in injuries to two Greyhound Commandos, and one of them died. Despite the police calling upon the Maoists to surrender, they did not pay heed to the warning and continued firing, constraining the police parties to retaliate by counter firing in self defence, the SP said. As a result of this firing incident, some Maoists died and some more escaped. The incident was reported at Chitrakonda Police Station of Malkangiri District and a case was registered, which is under investigation by the Odisha Police. On ascertaining from the Chitrakonda Police, it was revealed that they found 24 bodies at the scene of offence (13 men and 11 women), the SP added.

Seeking dismissal of the petition, Sharma said in the reply, Police have not violated the law and the incident of firing has taken place in Odisha and is being investigated into. The writ petition seems to have been filed by twisting the facts of a legitimate joint combing exercise and the counter firing in self defence. The court posted the matter for further hearing to November 8.	0	0	0	0

Diplomats from Afghanistan, India, and the United States (US) met in New York on the margins of the United Nations in the first formal trilateral meeting aimed at overcoming Pakistan s selective blockade of landlocked Afghanistan, reports Times of India on September 23. The meeting provided a forum for the US Government and the Government of India to explore ways to coordinate and align their assistance with the priorities of the Afghan government, a joint statement following the meeting said, amid reports that Pakistan has declined to allow Indian wheat supplies and other humanitarian aid overland to Afghanistan. The blockade has angered Kabul, which has sought trade and transit routes to and from India through Pakistan. It has gone so far as to warn Islamabad that it can retaliate if that is not granted by restricting Pakistan s access to Central Asia.The US, which essentially buys access to Afghanistan through Pakistan with aid (in the form of Coalition Support Funds and through multilateral agency) is trying to broker an agreement. But going beyond that the three sides are also looking at other options as Pakistan s belligerence and hostility has increased sharply in recent months. There have been frequent calls in Pakistan to stop US access even though the rent extraction has proved to be profitable for the Pakistani establishment and its elites. US detente with Iran over the past year is also opening up access to Afghanistan through Chabahar port in which India is heavily invested, enabling all three sides to circumvent Pakistan.	0	0	0	0

Technology Research and Atomic Energy Minister and JHU leader Patali Champika Ranawaka called on the government on May 23 to initiate a comprehensive programme to wipe out the idea of Eelam from Sri Lanka’s social, economic, intellectual and cultural life, reports Daily News. “The time has come to initiate comprehensive de Eelamification programme in the country,” he pointed out. The Minister announced his plans to submit an individual member motion in Parliament to abrogate the 13th Amendment and the Provincial Council system. Ranawaka said members of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) still espouse the notion of Tamil Eelam. “It is essential to remove this notion from the country as a counter terrorism measure by implementing law if necessary. After the liberation of Germany in 1945, the Allied Powers initiated a denazification program whereby they prohibited NSDAP party and its subdivisions. They also dismissed NSDAP party members from executive positions in industry and office. Nazi laws were abolished and symbols removed from use. In the case of Libya, after Libya has been liberated from Muammar Gaddafi’s 42 year rule of government, the Libyan Parliament voted to ban ex Gadaffi officials from holding any position in government or even in a political party. This is to ensure national interest and security,” explained Ranawaka. He also said Visuavanathan Rudrakumaran, a former advisor to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ‘International Secretariat’, who is also known as the driving force behind an organization called, Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE), has reportedly become a Prime Minister of that government. “There are senior officials of Western nations that have become receptive to Rudrakumaran’s action. A process of de Eelamification helps ban such activities and their influence on Tamil public in Sri Lanka,” he added.	0	0	0	0

Pakistan has been submitting exaggerated and inaccurate bills for the billions of dollars US pays to fight militants along the Afghanistan border and the Pentagon has been rejecting 40 per cent of its claims, Indian Express quoting a Wall Street Journal report said on May 18. The billing spat has exacerbated tensions between the countries, which reached a nadir after the US raided the compound of Osama bin Laden without informing Pakistani authorities, a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report said. There was no immediate comment from the Pentagon. The WSJ said the records detail USD 3.2 billion in expense claims submitted to the US for operations from January 2009 through June 2010. According to the documents and interviews with officials, Pakistan has routinely submitted requests that were unsubstantiated, or were deemed by the US to be exaggerated or of little or no use in the war on terror underscoring what officials and experts see as a deep undercurrent of mistrust between the supposed allies, the WSJ said. In another case, the US paid millions to refurbish four helicopters to help Pakistans army transport troops into battle against Taliban and other militants. But the Pakistanis ended up diverting three of those aircraft to peacekeeping duties in Sudan operations for which Islamabad receives compensation from the United Nations, US officials said.

With Malda District emerging as the capital of Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN), the internal security committee in West Bengal has decided to meet officials of central agencies dealing with the issue in the state, Economic Times reports on January 2. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started 30 cases of FICN smuggling in which the agency found links with terror modules and money laundering networks. In 2015, the Border Security Force (BSF) seized INR 2,60,82,000 of FICN from the Malda border alone and apprehended 24 couriers. Every day they are changing their modus operandi. The most serious issue is not being able to reach the kingpin of these rackets. In no case, we could arrest the handlers. The couriers are arrested and the links get disconnected. At least five agencies are now working together on FICN. However, the seized amount is only 10 per cent of the total flow, said a senior official of the committee. The couriers make 2 to 5 per cent on each consignment; profits are huge for those who run the trade. The kingpins get 50 per cent of the amount smuggled into India. Moreover, the racketeers often have links to the terror modules. Mobile phones have reduced the risk, giving smuggling a boost and attracting more people into the racket. The network of Grameenphone, a leading telecom operator in Bangladesh, spills over into the Indian side, making it easier for the smugglers to coordinate their act.	0	0	0	0

According to an April 1 Times of India report, self radicalized youth seething with a sense of injustice to Muslims are reaching out to the jihadi outfits to volunteer to work for them. Interrogation of Indian Mujahideen (IM) and Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) operatives in connection with the February 21, 2013, Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh) blasts has brought out what security and intelligence agency call the deeply worrying trend , where terror groups are able to find recruits without having to work really hard. The National Investigation Agencys (NIA) interrogation of IM operatives Syed Maqbool and Imran Khan and LeT militants Obaidur Rehman also revealed that the new recruits had no qualms about switching loyalties from one group to another.

This is a worrying trend and can cause greater problems in future as now merely monitoring and controlling operations of terror groups will not help, said an unnamed officer.	0	0	0	0

Chief Justice (CJ) Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, heading a five member bench, on August 26 observed that for the last one month situation in Karachi had been out of control and there was a complete breakdown of the government’s machinery, according to Daily Times. “People are being abducted for ransom beheaded dead bodies of innocents with tied arms and legs, wrapped in sacks, are being recovered in large numbers daily and street crime is rampant,” the CJ observed. He said that target killings took place in other provinces as well, but for the last one month Karachi’s situation had worsened, adding, “It’s high time that someone should take responsibility of Karachi’s mayhem.” The CJ, while rejecting the federal and Sindh governments’ report regarding worsening law and order situation in Karachi, again sought comprehensive report from them on the subject after consultations with intelligence agencies. The apex court observed that it seemed that there was lack of coordination among intelligence agencies regarding sharing of information over law and order situation in Karachi. The Inspector General of Police (Karachi) was directed to proceed against the target killers across the board, irrespective of their party affiliations, and also provide detail of Police Stations and the crimes that take place in their jurisdiction and the manner people were being killed there. The IG was also directed to file details of injured persons, loss of properties and whether people had been arrested and responsibilities had been fixed. During the course of proceedings, Sindh government submitted a detailed report on the incidents of target killings, which have been taking place in Karachi for the last more than one month. According to the report, 300 people were murdered in incidents of target killings, as 232 cases were registered. The report stated that 117 target killers had been arrested and the challans of 179 accused were submitted in the court. Sindh Attorney General contended that judiciary could not resolve the issue of Karachi, as one target killer, who was involved in 100 cases of murder, had been acquitted by the court. Upon this, the CJ remarked that the court could not award punishment without evidences, and it was failure of the investigating agencies, which could not submit proofs to the courts.	0	0	0	0

After arresting over 50 suspects for conspiring to set up terror modules inspired by the Islamic State (IS) or for providing material support to the militant group, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has identified another 130 radicalised individuals, believed to be in contact with the accused, dnaindia.com reports on October 12. This watch list is a preemptive measure by the agency to track and monitor these individuals.The individuals on the watch list have not participated in any incriminating activities till now. They are, however, active on the social media and have made efforts on ground to gather support for IS, officials said. They ve tried to gather support for IS online and offline and enroll other members. They themselves, however, have refrained from joining any module, they added. The decision to put these individuals under surveillance was taken recently, after a few names cropped up frequently during interrogations. Consequently, the NIA wrote to police authorities in nine states Delhi, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Haryana asking them to monitor these supporters. We don t have any strong evidence against these people. Their names have cropped up during interrogations of accused. For now, we only know that they are radicalised and believe in the IS ideology, a senior NIA said. The state police have been given the responsibility to track down these individuals and question them, if needed. In several cases, investigators observed common links as IS supporters were part of WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages or used encrypted platforms for communication.	0	0	0	0

The Government will setup a national welfare centre in the country s war ravaged North to uplift Tamil families headed by women or the victims of the nearly three decades long civil war in the country, said Prime Minister (PM) Ranil Wickremesinghes office on April 5, reports Niti Central. The national centre will be located in Kilinochchi in Northern Province, the former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) administrative centre, PMs office said in a statement. The decision was taken following a request made by the Northern people to set up the centre in Kilinochchi where most women had lost their husbands in the conflict. It is a well known fact that most suffered persons due to a war are women and children. In the north alone there are nearly 50,000 families that are headed by women. They are made destitute due to their inability to provide food, accommodation and educational needs to their children, the statement said. Based on a United Nations (UN) report on women headed households, Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee to look at ways to uplift social and economic conditions of women headed households. Since coming into power, the new Government has taken significant steps to bring normalcy in the North. The Government has returned some military acquired land to original Tamil owners. A travel restriction for foreigners travelling to the North imposed by the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime has also been lifted. According to UN estimates, up to 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed by Security Forces (SFs) during former president Mahinda Rajapaksa s regime that brought an end to the nearly three decades long war in the country with the defeat of the LTTE in 2009.	0	0	0	0

Outgoing Union Home Secretary G. K. Pillai on June 30 conceded that Abujhmaad was liberated zone and totally under Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) control, but argued that this area too would eventually be taken over by Government forces, reports Telegraph. Its just a matter of time before the Maoists top leadership is captured or eliminated and the rest pushed back into Abujhmaad, Pillai said. He accepted that over the past few years, the Maoists had been able to consolidate their gains in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa while expanding to Bihar. Even though there has been some increase (in Maoist held areas), as we build up our forces over the next few years... the Maoists will find themselves on the run. As I have said, it is a long haul. It will take five to seven years, Pillai told Telegraph. For all that, the Maoists have carved out a corridor connecting various liberated or guerrilla zones, allowing them a continuous passage from Khammam in Andhra to Jharkhand via south Chhattisgarhs Bijapur district and the Orissa Chhattisgarh border. Sources have said the rebels have taken over several areas in Orissas Nuapada and Bolangir. But Pillai said, Nuapada No one (from the forces) was there. In another years time we will take back all these areas. The so called liberated areas were with them because there was a vacuum and they filled it.... We will fill it back once we enter we will build up roads, communication. They will go away from there and enter Abujhmaad and we will finally take Abujhmaad too.	0	0	0	0

The new MPVs have five major upgrades. A better air conditioning system to ensure that the Policemen seated in the backroom behind the cabin will not feel smothered as used to happen in the earlier vehicle. It has transparent glass windows now instead of opaque like in the earlier versions that will eliminate the need to look through the holes in the panes to take an aim at the enemy. The new vehicles have broad and puncture proof tyres. The biggest improvement, however, is in terms of the strength of the vehicle to withstand blasts.

The Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on October 16 defended the attack on Malala Yusufzai, rejecting that she was an innocent girl and labelling her as a spy of the United States (US), reports The News. The central ‘spokesman’ of TTP, Ehsanullah Ehsan, in a detailed statement issued to the media said Malala s date of birth is July 1997 which makes her 15 years four months old today. Even if no sign of maturity becomes noticeable, this age of the girl marks the end of pre maturity phase. The statement said, In Islam and Pakhtun traditions there is absolutely no room for an attack on a woman of pure virtues. But in cases where a woman is seen as a clear sinner who stands in defiance of Sharia’h (Islamic Law), such a woman is not only allowed to be attacked but there is an obligatory instruction for such an action. She has received the punishment for her sin, he said. Stating another reason, the ‘spokesman’ said, The other reason for the attack on Malala was her activism aimed at sparking a feud within the Islamic society of Pakhtuns. He clarified that she was not attacked for her pursuit of education. Had it been for education, then there are scores of girls who go out to school (they would have been attacked too). Taliban executed the attack on an adult girl only after she emerged as a pivotal character in the media war against us, the ‘spokesman’ argued.	0	0	0	0

The United States (US) cannot reassure Pakistan against any Indian threat if it fails to commit itself towards working against anti India terrorist groups operating within its territory, two US experts on South Asian issues have told American lawmakers, reports The Economic Times on February 27. George Perkovich, vice president for Studies Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said during a Congressional hearing on February 25, If Pakistan can t commit itself to working against the terrorists that have operated in India, then there s not much we can do to reassure them, there s probably not much we should do to reassure them, because that really is a problem. Responding to questions from lawmakers, Perkovich said the good news is India has no desires for any Pakistani territory or anything in Pakistan. So threat from India is only in response to Pakistani aggression in India or terrorism in India, he said. Testifying before the same committee, Ashley Tellis from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said while there was much enthusiasm in the Pakistan Army to take action against those terrorist groups that they perceive is a threat to Pakistan, the same can t be said about anti India terrorist groups. He said the question was whether Pakistanis will not extend this effort to groups that do not directly threaten Pakistan, but threaten others like Afghanistan, US forces in Afghanistan and India. I think we would declare victory only when Pakistanis begin to think of terrorism in a sort of broader context, and begin to focus their attention on all terrorist groups, and not pick and choose between groups that support their interests, Tellis said.	0	0	0	0

We needed a scientific estimate of fake notes in circulation. That’s why the ISI was asked by the National Investigation Agency, the nodal agency in the matter, to carry out a study,” the official added. The study compiled data from all stakeholders the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and others. Data for the total value of FICN detected and seized in India and abroad over the last five years varied between INR 24 crore and INR 46 crore.

Thousands of people protesting United States (US) drone strikes blocked a road in Peshawar on November 23 used to truck NATO troop supplies and equipment in and out of Afghanistan, reports The News. The protest, Imran Khan, had more symbolic value than practical impact as there is normally little NATO supply traffic on the road. The blocked route in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province leads to one of two border crossings used to send supplies overland from Pakistan to neighbouring Afghanistan. Khan, whose Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) party runs the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government, called on Federal officials to take a firmer stance to force the US to end drone attacks and block NATO supplies across the country. We will put pressure on America, and our protest will continue if drone attacks are not stopped, Khan told the protesters. Meanwhile, the PTIs decision to choke NATO supply routes could deprive Pakistan of billions of dollars it receives from the US in financial aid, according to experts and Government officials, reports The Express Tribune. Under the Ground Lines of Communication (GLOC) agreement with the US, Pakistan receives an estimated USD 1,500 1,800 for every truck that carries supplies for NATO forces through the country, Government officials said. The bill amounts to roughly USD one million per day, they added. In addition to depriving Pakistan of the direct payment it receives for allowing NATO supplies to pass through its territory, violating the GLOC agreement may also prompt the US to withhold the USD 1.2 billion Pakistan hopes to receive under the Coalition Support Fund, the officials said. The amount has already been included in the countrys budget for the current fiscal year.	0	0	0	0

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has established involvement of the crime syndicate led by Dawood Ibrahim in the attempt to smuggle Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN), with face value of INR 9, 75,000 through the Nedumbassery airport in 2013, New Indian Express reports on March 21. In the final report of the case filed before the NIA Court, the NIA has included Dawood Ibrahim’s henchman Aftab Batki, who heads the FICN network of the gang, as accused. A red corner notice by the Interpol is pending against Aftab.The conspiracy pertaining to the smuggling of fake currency notes through the Nedumbassery airport started in October 2012. It all began when Manjeri native Kunjumuhammad who was lodged in the Arthur Road Prison, Mumbai, in connection with a narcotic case struck a deal with Kasargode native K M Abdullah who was accused in the sensational Hamza murder case. “Abdullah gave Kinjumuhammed the mobile number of Aftab, who handles Dawood’s fake currency business across India with many cases pending against him,” stated the NIA report.Later, Abdullah introduced Kunjumuhammed to Antony Das of Valparai, Coimbatore, and Perinjanam native Muhammed Haneefa, and they hatched the conspiracy to smuggle high quality fake currency notes from the Gulf to India. In October 2012, Antony Das invested 4 lakh for the operation, and sent the money to Kunjumuhammed who was in West Asia.Kunjumuhammed then contacted Aftab in Pakistam and arranged the fake Indian currency notes that were in the safe custody of Mohammed Haneefa in Dubai. Later, Kunjumuhammed arranged Abid Chullikulavan as carrier of the fake currency notes with the help of Abdul Salam, and offered him 50,000 as commission. In January 2013, Customs officials arrested Abid when he arrived at the Nedumbassery airport with the fake Indian currency notes, handed over to him by Antony Das.According to the NIA report, “counterfeiting of high quality Indian currency notes is rampant by Dawood Ibrahim’s crime syndicate, with the aim of weakening the Indian economy.” A former NIA official said investigation of many cases registered in other parts of country had established the nexus between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Dawood’s crime syndicate. “The fake notes are printed using highly sophisticated machines set up exclusively for the purpose. Even the minutest details of the original Indian currency notes are duplicated with perfection. So far, Pakistan is the only country where fake Indian currencies are found to have been printed,” added the report.	0	0	0	0

Peshawar Corps Commander Lieutenant General Khalid Rabbani on September 24 called for action against terrorist groups in southern Punjab and Balochistan, saying the ‘successful’ Zarb e Azb operation was not enough to end the terrorist threat in the country, reports Dawn. “Terrorism cannot be eliminated without intelligence based operations throughout the country particularly in Southern Punjab and Sindh,” he said. He called for greater focus of these operations in Southern Punjab and Balochistan and a stronger political backing for these actions. He stated that political indecisiveness had already delayed Zarb e Azb for at least three years. He said it was agreed in principle that “military means must be politically driven”. This, he maintained, led to delay in start of the operation. The army, General Rabbani said, had been trying to convince the government since 2011 for starting an operation in North Waziristan Agency. “The nation had wanted to wish away the problem in North Waziristan not realising its gravity,” he said, adding that “had our leaders seen what was coming and taken timely decisions a lot of casualties could have been avoided”. Talking about the progress in Zarb e Azb, the Corps Commander claimed a major portion of the tribal agency’s 4,707 square kilometres had been cleared. He likened the Boya Degan region of North Waziristan, now ‘cleared’ by military recently, to “Pentagon of al Qaeda”, which housed the terror group’s communication network and command and control centre. “Our action has destroyed their system, wherewithal and will to fight,” he added.

Individuals and institutions in Saudi Arabia are pumping in millions of rupees into India to open religious trusts and Non Governmental Organisations, reveal the diplomatic documents released by WikiLeaks, Sunday Guardian reports on June 27. Officials with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) have termed this as an attempt to help spread and propagate Wahhabism in the country . An undated document, which according to WikiLeaks, originated from the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in New Delhi, contains the list of Indian institutions and societies that have applied for financial assistance. The document suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia itself pledged donations to nine such institutions located across different states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Maharashtra. Saudi Arabia pledged 2.5 million Saudi Riyal (SR) to Islamic Mission Trust, Malpurram (Mallapuram) in Kerala, which is registered with the UMHA, ostensibly for constructing an arts and science college building. Similarly, it also pledged 1 million SR to the Kerala branch of Islamic Welfare Trust for constructing a nursing college. A similar amount was also pledged to the Palghat Mujahideen Arabic College Committee in Kerala for the purpose of extending an existing medical college and the Karuma hospital building. In Uttar Pradesh, 75,000 SR were pledged to two different societies for establishing a madrasa (Islamic seminary) building and establishing a vocational centre for girls in Mirzapur and Siddharth Nagar, respectively. WikiLeaks also released documents that showed that the Secretariat General of the Muslim World League (Mecca), a controversial organisation, had requested Saudi Arabia to encourage establishing Wahhabi centres in India. Sources in the MHA feel that the Saudi government is concerned about the growing influence of the Shia community in India and Iran s increasing closeness to India and sees this phenomenon as a threat to the majority Sunni population in the country, something that has been mentioned in their diplomatic correspondence which has been released by WikiLeaks. According to officials, India s Shia population is the world s second largest after Iran. To counter the increasing Shia influence, a certain section in the Saudi establishment has been propagating Wahhabism in India, says an UMHA official.	0	0	0	0

According to reports there appears to be contradictory views about the Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) setting up the Burdwan (West Bengal) module, as the National Investigating Agency (NIA) in its chargesheet is likely to suggest that the operation was aimed at carrying out terror strikes in India, while Bangladesh continues to maintain that the intention of the JMB was to hit at the Sheikh Hasina regime, reports One India on February 24. The NIA says that on interrogation of the all the accused persons it has learnt that they had been setting up modules to carry out strikes in West Bengal, Assam among other states in India. Bangladesh on the other hand says that the JMB has only one intention and that is to shake up Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina and her government. They found it hard to set up modules in Bangladesh and hence chose West Bengal where they were readying a module to strike at the Awami League (AL) led by Sheikh Hasina. The NIA says that in its chargesheet to be filed next month it would state that these people part of the Burdwan module were planning on setting up several terror cells in India. The intention was to provide aid to other terror groups and also carry out a series of attacks in India, including a major one in Kolkata. The NIA says that the JMB is in a running battle against the Sheikh Hasina government, but that does not mean they would set up modules in India for that purpose. We have investigated that angle too and have found that the intention was only to destablise India. Further the NIA points out that part of the chargesheet would also deal with how the JMB with the help of local modules raised the Burdwan module and also gathered funds locally. The NIA also states that the investigation is an ongoing one and they could file additional chargesheets in the future. We have modules in Assam and Jharkhand also to be investigated and these things take time, the NIA official also maintained. However Bangladesh is firm and says that the operatives that they have questioned in connection with the same case say that the intention was to carry out strikes in Bangladesh. Bangladesh investigators point out that the JMB was using India to build up their module. They even procured funds within India to fund the module. They wanted to prepare bombs in India and transport it to Bangladesh, investigations over there have also found. Meanwhile, Bangladesh would request India to extradite all the accused India has arrested in connection with the Burdwan blasts case, adds One India. Bangladesh contends that the entire module was being set up to commit an offence in Bangladesh and hence all of them be extradited.	0	0	0	0

Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on September 25 (today), said that India will reply if Pakistan s Prime Minister (PM) Nawaz Sharif raises the Kashmir issue in his address at the United Nation (UN) General Assembly, reports The Times of India. On being asked whether India has taken notice of a statement reportedly made by Sharif in this regard, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said When a statement comes from him (on Kashmir), then we will reply. On a question that Pakistan PM Sharif will be raising the issue in his address to the UN, Swarup said, The first thing is, has any action been taken by the United Nations If there is an action taken by the UN, we will respond appropriately, and if no action is taken by the UN, it itself tells that nobody has taken the cognisance. In the interim, reacting to the allegations made by Pakistan that India was raising a 197 kilometers long, 10 meter high and 135 foot wide wall on the Line of Control (LoC), MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said that India was aware of the two letters written by Pakistan to the UN. The first letter was written on September 4, which states that there was no bilateral dialogue. After that the Border Security Force (BSF) and Pakistan Rangers have already met. So the letter has itself contradicted itself that there is no dialogue as there has been a dialogue, said Swarup in response to a question by ANI s Smita Prakash. He added, As far as the second letter is concerned, I believe, it is based on some kind of submission made by Mr. Salahuddin, whom we consider to be a global terrorist. We will respond at appropriate time.	0	0	0	0

Pakistan has told India it is was working towards a ban on Jama at ud Dawa (JuD), a front for Lashkar e Toiba (LeT), but the fate of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the 26 11 Mumbai attack architect, was entirely for the court to decide, reports Hindustan Times on February 19. According to the sources, Islamabad sensitised New Delhi on the two issues during a string of under the radar meetings that National Security Adviser (NSA) AK Doval held with Pakistan High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit. These meetings paved the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi s cricket diplomacy. A Pakistan official involved in the negotiation process said that We are trying to ban the JuD because it was placed on the list of banned organsiations by the United Nations (UN) soon after the Mumbai attacks in 2008. Sources said that when foreign secretary S Jaishankar travels to Islamabad early March as part of his South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) yatra, he was likely to take forward discussions on concerns flagged by Doval and Basit. However, an official said Hafiz Saeed was set free through the courts and the same may happen with Lakhvi, and the prosecution is trying its best but it is for the courts to take a final call based on evidence. Report concluded that bail for Lakhvi will complicate the dialogue process which looks set to resume after six months.	0	0	0	0

Pakistan s Prime Minister (PM) Nawaz Sharif on September 30, called for an expanded United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to monitor the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, as part of what he proposed would be a new peace process between the two countries, reports The Times of India. In an address to the United Nations (UN) that was widely anticipated in the subcontinent because of previews in Pakistan that he would present evidence of India fomenting unrest in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif came up with zilch. Aside from generically saying neighbors should not foment instability in Pakistan (which could apply to several countries) there were no charges, forget any shred of evidence, which Sharif s National Security Advisor (NSA) and other officials had promised to produce. Instead, it was a familiar lament about how Kashmir has been neglected by the UN and resolutions on the issue had not been taken up, although Pakistan stands in violation of most aspects of the resolution such as vacating Occupied Kashmir. Global threat of terrorism cannot be defeated without addressing the underlying causes, Sharif said, repeating an argument that has been largely discredited as validating terrorism. Without naming India, he said some countries were suppressing the rights of self determination in the name of fighting terrorism. Sharif said he had reached out to the Indian leadership when the new dispensation took over in New Delhi last year but things had gone south with the escalation in border tension in recent days. To avert further escalation, he was proposing a new peace with India with steps, including formalising and respecting the 2003 understanding on ceasefire with a ramped up UNMOGIP, an affirmation that neither side will resort to force or threat of use of force, steps to demilitarize Kashmir, and mutual withdrawal from Siachen. Earlier, indirectly accusing India for its instability, Sharif said in his United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) speech, Wisdom dictates that our immediate neighbor refrains from fomenting instability in Pakistan. The two countries should address and resolve causes of tension and take all possible measures to avert further escalation. Countering Sharif s charges, Swarup said, Pakistan s instability arises from its breeding of terrorists. Blaming neighbours is not a solution. Sharif in his speech also suggested a new peace initiative between the two countries. One of the ways to achieve peace, according to him, was to demilitarize Kashmir. Apart from this, he also wanted unconditional and mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world s highest battle ground. Swarup seem to have reacted to this in his tweet To de militarize Kashmir is not the answer, to de terrorize Pakistan is. In another tweet, he said Pakistan is not primary victim of terrorism but of its own policies. It is in fact the prime sponsor of terrorism. Separately, Pakistan PM Sharif on September 30, proposed a new four point peace initiative which includes demilitarisation of Kashmir and unconditional withdrawal of forces from Siachen, reports The Times of India. Addressing the UNGA, he also proposed restraint by both countries from use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances and formalisation of the 2003 border ceasefire as part of the formula to ensure peaceful ties between the two nuclear armed neighbours. Sharif suggested four ways in this initiative. I want to use this opportunity today to propose a new peace initiative with India starting with measures that are simplest to implement, he said. Sharif s four points We propose that Pakistan and India formalize and respect the 2003 understanding for a complete ceasefire on the Line of Control in Kashmir. For this purpose, we call for UNMOGIP expansion to monitor the observance of ceasefire. We propose that Pakistan and India reaffirm that they will not resort to the use or the threat of use of force under any circumstances. This is a central element of the UN charter. Steps must be taken to demilitarize Kashmir Agree to unconditional mutual withdrawal from Siachen Glacier, the world s highest battle ground.	0	0	0	0

A report of the Union Ministry for Home Affairs (UMHA) clearly shows that the number of acquittals in the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) related cases are extremely high, reports oneindia.com. Out of the 111 cases registered against SIMI members, 97 have resulted in acquittals. There are a variety of reasons behind the high rate of acquittals where SIMI cases are concerned. Several Police personnel have been blamed for being vindictive in their approach which just does not help the cause. First and foremost being a former member of the SIMI does not mean an arrest is mandated. Secondly, many arrests have been carried out just on the basis that the persons have been viewing a video or reading the Quran. The other side of the problem is the lack of material against persons. The acquittal rate is high especially in the case of accused persons who are lower in the ranks. It is very difficult to establish a case and get evidence against such persons. Moreover there is also a delay in handing over the cases to the centralised agency which is the National Investigating Agency (NIA).	0	0	0	0

It may be even more difficult to identify a genuine INR 500 note from a fake one as the currency being smuggled into India by inimical agencies is now a closer imitation of the original, Delhi Police have cautioned, The Times of India reports on March 15. Officers of the Delhi Police Special Cell point to the role of Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) agency in pushing through notes which have a greater resemblance to India s high denomination INR 500 and INR 1,000 notes. The officers said that they have been noticing for the past few months that differences between genuine and Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN) were reducing and that around five such differences have actually disappeared. The paper being used to make the fake notes is now more similar. The stiffness is almost the same. The security thread (in the right half) on fake notes also resembles that on the genuine currency. The watermark (the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi in light and shade) has also been nearly matched, an officer, stated. The ISI has developed high quality FICN and is pumping these into India with the help of several syndicates. These notes are similar to the genuine ones and it is not easy for the common man to detect them, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav said. Intelligence agencies are worried that despite some traditional routes of FICN smuggling being neutralized, the flow of counterfeit currency has not slowed.	0	0	0	0

Citing the November 26, 2008 (26 11) Mumbai (Maharashtra) terror attack and four other cases, the March 25, 2015 released FBI 9 11 Review Commission report concluded that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) needs faster reforms to transform itself into a threat based, intelligence driven organisation, New Indian Express reports on March 26. One of the key plotters of 26 11, Pakistani American David Coleman Headley, the report noted had previously come to the attention of US law enforcement authorities but FBI officials repeatedly concluded that Headley did not pose a threat at the time. The increasingly complex and dangerous threat environment it faces will require no less, said the report which studied FBI investigations into five significant terrorism events. In none of those cases did a confidential source provide actionable intelligence to help prevent or respond to a terrorist operation, the report said. In December 2007, Headley s Moroccan wife complained to US officials at the US Embassy in Islamabad (Capital of Pakistan) that her husband was a terrorist. But the FBI investigation of Headley did not begin until 2009, and it was triggered by a tip that originated outside the FBI that revealed his relationships with extremists abroad, the report said. One of the main lessons from the Headley case is that absent an intelligence effort across the US Intelligence Community to understand the connections among cases and complaints across field offices, relevant intelligence may fall by the wayside, it said. News outlets, it noted, have reported, prior to his terrorist activities, Headley had worked as a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informant in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, following two heroin trafficking arrests. A single complaint may be more easily dismissed as a poison pen motive, but several unrelated complaints should not be dismissed as readily as the work of a malcontent, the report said. The Headley case raises the important question faced by all intelligence agencies certainly important to the FBI of how to scan and assess voluminous amounts of collected information strategically and identifying valuable intelligence leads, the report said. Still, more than a decade after 9 11, the FBI must prioritize empowering and equipping its analytic cadre to make these connections with cutting edge technology, to minimize the risk of the FBI missing important intelligence information, it said. The FBI had no knowledge of Headley s connections to Lashkar i Taiba (LeT) until provided with a tip that originated outside the FBI that prompted the investigation in 2009.	0	0	0	0

Unidentified militants on June 26 lobbed a hand grenade into a house in Jatti Payan area under Daudzai Police Station in Peshawar, the provincial capital of KP, reports The News. The blast damaged the house but did not result in any casualty. There were reports that another explosive device that did not go off was later defused by the bomb disposal unit.Meanwhile, the KP Government on June 26 made a drastic cut in the funds for minorities, allocating a whopping PKR 300 million for the Darul Uloom Haqqania, reports The News. In the last year’s budgetary allocation made for the Department of Auqaf and Minority Affairs, 52.70 was earmarked for the welfare of minorities in the Annual Development Programme in contrast with 23.49 this year, an examination of the budget documents and discussion with relevant officials reveal. While a disproportionate increase has been registered in funds for Auqaf and a major chunk went to the Darul Uloom Haqqania, the funds reserved for textbooks and fees for deserving students in Christian institutions like convent schools have been reduced. The cuts in allocations for medical grants and dowry fund for minority members are separate from this. This reduction has occurred in the absence of any Minister holding the portfolio of Minority Affairs. Suran Singh, murdered in April 2016, was the last in charge of this Ministry.	0	1	0	0

A key accused in the Bengaluru serial blasts of July 25, 2008, K P Sabeeralias Mohammed SabeeraliasAyub is living in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Pakistan,investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Kerala Police have revealed, Indian Express reports on May 30. Sabeer, allegedly linked to the Lashkar e Taiba (LeT), had fallen off the radar of investigating agencies after fleeing India on a fake passport in November 2008. He was also the former president of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in Kerala.His whereabouts have reportedly emerged now following investigations around K A Anoop, an alleged associate of Sabeer who was deported from the UAE in April, 2016. The NIA had arrested Anoop on April 8, 2016, after he was detained on his arrival at IGI Airport, New Delhi in connection with the September 2005 Kalamassery (Kochi) bus burning case. Sources familiar with the investigations claimed the two were in touch and that analysis of Anoop’s Dubai phone call records has revealed a number linked to Sabeer. “He has been trying to take his wife to Pakistan and has been offering 100,000 dirhams to obtain travel documents for her. This is the first time in many years that some information has emerged about Sabeer,” said sources.The NIA’s investigations in the 2008 case allegedly found that Sabeer had taken five youth — Fayas, Fayis, Abdul Rahim, Mohd. Yasin and Abdul Jabbar to Kashmir in September 2008 and handed them over to an LeT operative. The youths were allegedly being taken to an LeT camp for training but four of them were killed in an encounter with Indian security forces. Abdul Jabbar, the only one to escape, was later arrested by Kerala Police.The killing of the four and the investigations around their presence in Kashmir led investigators to unravel the mystery behind the Bengaluru blasts, which were allegedly executed withLeT funding, with Sabeer allegedly acting as the key Indian conduit in channelling funds and mobilising men for the Pakistan based terror organisation.According to the NIA, he used the passport of a daily wager, ShameerKollamkudyAlikutty, who is still living in Kerala, to escape. The NIA has found an airport departure card, which showed that he left for Dubai on an Air India flight. “In the departure card, the country of residence has been mentioned as the UAE whereas the occupation was written as sales executive,” the NIA says. The fake passport was later found in a hotel on Kish Island in Iran, a few months after Sabeer left.Agencies also suspect that Sabeer’s “escape” was facilitated by the then keyLeT commander for the India region, RehanaliasWalialias Abdul Aziz alias Rashid Abdullah, who has also been linked to the 26 11 Mumbai terror attack. Wali is also been named along with Sabeer in the plot to recruit Kerala youths for terrorism.	0	0	0	0

Intelligence alerts on terrorist threats in Delhi were 50 per cent down over the past five years, Hindustan Times reports on December 11. Experts cautioned that the declining number didn’t mean New Delhi has become less vulnerable to attacks, especially from Pakistan based militant outfits such the Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT). The Jaish and Lashkar enjoy patronage from the Pakistani establishment and army, and are involved in this year’s Pathankot air base and Uri army camp attacks in which about two dozen Indian soldiers were killed. Pakistan denies the charge.The Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (R AW) alerted Delhi Police 306 times about possible terrorist attacks since 2012, which recorded the highest number of warnings at 77. In comparison, only 29 alerts have surfaced till September, 2016 a Delhi Police response to a right to information query revealed. “Broadly, we can divide these inputs into two parts. One is of general nature. Say possibilities of attack during Independence Day and Republic Day. We circulate these inputs to keep our forces on the toes,” a senior Delhi police officer said. He added, “The second type is specific. For instance, X person is coming to Delhi and staying in a particular hotel. We investigate and report back to the agency about the authenticity of the alert. No information is available on the authenticity of each and every alert.”Another aspect attributed to the decreasing alerts is the growing presence of Islamic State (IS) and al Qaeda sympathizers, and home grown militants. Intelligence agencies don’t share alerts in such cases, but take action with the help of local Police. Delhi Police arrested about a dozen militants in 2016; among them six IS sympathisers and two are from the al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). “None of them came directly from Pakistan. Agencies get information about Pakistan based terrorist through local informers and technical intervention such as call interception, including months of work such as data encryption as ISIS members interact through social media,” an officer said. Such cases go beyond the realm of alert, but invite actionable input that requires direct collaboration between the intelligence agency and police to arrest the militant. “That explains why number of terrorism related alerts is going down, though IS members are getting arrested increasingly,” the officer said.	0	0	0	0

He also supported Maoists in taking levies from contractors. “I supported Maoists as they have been protecting poor people from being exploited by the rich and affluent… in 1984, when I was a minister, there were allegations levelled against me that I was a supporter of Naxals…I’ve often been saying that to save the honour of women and daughters belonging to poor sections of society, and to protect them from various kinds of atrocities, if someone supports them and is called a Naxalite, then yes, I am the first Naxalite,” said Manjhi. He also added that Maoists, whether in Bihar or any other part of the country, were fighting for the cause of the poor and, “if they use force to protect the poor, there is nothing wrong in this”. He also defended the Maoist act of extorting levies from contractors engaged in the construction of roads and buildings in Maoist affected areas. “The contractors make lot of money by over estimating the project cost and there is no harm if the Maoists take levy from them, former Chief Minister Manjhi said while speaking to journalists in Patna. “We all know that an estimate scam is going on in the State and a work that can be done for Rs. 1 crore is being done at Rs. 5 crore. Contractors are not doing their work honestly and say that they have to pay money to public representatives and officers. If Naxals extort levy from such contractors, what wrong do they do?” asked the former Bihar CM. He also said that the July 19, 2016 encounter in which 10 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) commandos was killed was not the handiwork of the Maoists but criminals.	0	0	0	0

Though Qasim was known to be from JeM, there was still doubt on whether reference was being made on some other group planning an attack or was it a JeM module being sent on the job. Since JeM has not carried out any major attack in India in recent past, sources told that it was conjectured that the group was likely to be LeT. It has now turned out that Qasim was guiding the attackers over phone. India has named him along with Ashfaq Ahmed and Hafiz Abdul Shakur as the three Pakistani handlers . The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will now seek an arrest warrant against Qasim and the other two handlers. A red corner notice will also be issued against the three, said an official. During the probe, the NIA has also lifted DNA samples from the two cars used by the terrorists that will be matched with the already preserved body tissues. Once they are identified by Pakistan, we will try to verify them using these DNA samples, said a senior NIA official.	0	0	0	0

Further, main party in opposition UNP on June 25 said that it opposes the dilution of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution as proposed by the Government. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, the UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake, said that the 13th Amendment was a result of an accord between two sovereign nations and not a private agreement between Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the former Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene, as claimed by their critics. Critics of the 13th Amendment say the Indo Lanka agreement, which led to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution paving the way to create provincial councils, was thrusted upon Sri Lanka by India in 1987 during the height of the war with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a solution to the ethnic problem. The critics say now that the terrorist war is over the Amendment needs to be revised to suit the peaceful conditions in the country. They argue that the powers granted in the13th Amendment to provincial councils will lead to a separate state in the country. The theory that devolution would lead to separation was nonsensical and unacceptable, Attanayake said refuting the argument.	0	0	0	0

It may take Pakistani security agencies anything between one to two years to come out with Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN) of new INR 500 and INR 2,000 denomination, owing to a number of safety features that have been introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), according to Intelligence Bureau, Asian Age reports on December 16. Following the government’s demonetisation move last month, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) had asked intelligence agencies to closely monitor its impact on circulation of FICN and terror funding. According to government estimates, there is INR 400 crore of FICN in circulation in the economy at any given point of time. Following the demonetisation, circulation of FICN has been severely hit, intelligence agencies have informed the government.According to a recent report on impact of demonetisation on FICN and terror funding, the Intelligence Bureau stated that by the time, which is almost two years, Pakistani agencies are able to fine tune production of new Indian currency security agencies, particularly in states, should enhance their capacity to deal with menace even in the long run.The intelligence agency, in its report, has also advised that the RBI should once again review the safety features in the INR 500 and INR 2,000 notes and introduce new or change some of them following the duration that it suspects the Pak agencies will take to develop counterfeit currency. “The demonetisation drive is a great opportunity to completely remove menace of fake currency. According to our estimate, it will take close to two years for ISI and its terror operatives to develop good quality fakes. So by the time they develop the expertise for the same, the RBI should introduce new features and then it should make it a routine exercise,” a senior intelligence official said.	0	0	0	0

National Investigation Agency (NIA) is inching towards establishing the motive behind the April 2 ambush on an army convoy at Khonsa in Tirap District with the investigation suggesting it to be the handiwork of Isak Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN IM), reports The Telegraph on July 17. A source stated that It appears that the outfit had carried out the attack to avenge the killing and arrests of its cadres by security forces in Arunachal Pradesh. Their plan was to blow up the convoy but luckily the powerful bomb they had buried under a muddy patch on the road didn t go off or else the casualties would have been much higher. When the militants failed to detonate the remote controlled bomb and the first three trucks moved out of the kill zone, they opened fire on the last truck of the convoy and jawans sitting on the tailboard of the truck bore the brunt of the attack, Source also stated that The kind of explosives used and the way the ambush was carried out also suggest NSCN (I M) s involvement since its cadres are more adept in the use of explosives and better trained compared to the NSCN (K) cadres. He also said that according to information shared by the Arunachal Police NSCN IM militants comprising ‘sergeant major’ Ayo Tangkhul, ‘captain’ Kapai, lieutenant Ami Tangkhul, ‘lieutenant colonel’ Kewang Hassik, ‘major’ Anok Wangsu and ‘sergeant major’ Chenaye Tangkhul alias Ayo are suspected to have carried out the attack with the help of some villagers, reports The Telegraph.	0	0	0	0

Pakistan uses militants as proxies to counter India s growing influence in Afghanistan, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Brennan has said in an email, which has been hacked and released by WikiLeaks, The Times of India reports on October 26. The email is among documents, released by the whistleblower website and deemed classified by the CIA, contained reports on Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also ideas for US policy towards Iran. Brennan, three days after Barack Obama was elected US President in November 2008, wrote to him in a position cum strategy paper that Pakistan uses the Taliban to counter India in Afghanistan. Pakistan s desire to counter India s growing influence in Afghanistan and concerns about US long term commitments to Afghanistan increase Pakistan s interest in hedging its bets by ensuring that it will be able to have a working relationship with the Taliban to balance Indian and Iranian interests if the US withdraws, Brennan wrote on November 7, 2008. Brennan, then a top foreign policy and counter terrorism adviser to Obama, then a president elect, was in the running to be CIA Director. Brennan s views on Pakistan was disclosed in a 13 page executive summary of key findings and recommendations on Afghanistan and Pakistan. Brennan, in the summary, said efforts in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) have been challenged by Pakistan s ambivalence towards, and perhaps outright support for, the Taliban. While the US Intelligence Community differs on the extent of the relationships, at least some elements of Pakistan s military and intelligence services appear to be ambivalent about the anti Taliban and anti militant mission in the FATA, in part due to their history of close ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan s conflict with the Soviet Union and Pakistan s use of militant proxies in its conflict with India, he wrote.	0	0	0	0

Visiting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in New Delhi on September 14 criticized Pakistan’s policy of choosing between terrorists,Times of India reports. Making a distinction between good and bad terrorism is an approach that is enormously short sighted. Those who think they can manipulate the psychology of this phenomenon or affect the pathology are mistaken, said Ghani. Good terrorists are the ones that attack your neighbours; bad terrorists are the ones who attack you. This type of approach is enormously short sighted. The blowback is going to be bad. Terrorism will bite like a snake whoever feeds it, he added. Terrorism will bite probably like a snake. States need to have a common perspective, he warned. Ghani also said the threat of terrorism is not a passing threat, and that terrorist organisations change very rapidly, even if their objectives remain the same.He also categorically hit out at those using religion to justify terrorist acts, saying Islam does not condone terrorism. A tiny minority cannot be allowed to hijack a civilization and a religion. There is no terrorism in the past 160 years except for adherence, practitioners from every civilization that we take. So, there is no reason to demonize a certain civilization. But on the other hand, members of that community have an obligation to speak truth to violence, Ghani said. It is unacceptable to speak in the name of Islam. Islam does not allow for terrorism. Terrorism must be condemned and we must stand together to contain it. Extremism cannot be permitted a platform. This is denial of everything that we stand for, and everything that civilization has stood for, he added.He also stressed that Afghanistan does not allow terrorists to launch attacks from its soil, despite the fact that it is under attack.Ghani said that south Asia is reeling under two wars — one in Afghanistan which is not a civil war and the other in Pakistan. However, he said, the war in Pakistan is not being covered adequately by the media. Around 2,700 (Pakistani) forces moved to the north western province and also Balochistan; this violence needs to be covered (by media) as people need to talk about it to address it, Ghani said while answering questions. However, to a specific question on whether he would support the independence movement in Balochistan, he said his country and his government do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country.

Areeb Majeed, Islamic State (IS) operative revealed the names of the local contacts, who allegedly provided him the logistics to join the group to take part in the battle in Iraq, National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials said on November 30, reports The Times of India. Majeed was today grilled for several hours when he revealed the names of the local contacts, who radicalised him and his three other friends here, and helped them fly to Iraq. We are verifying his claims and are trying to locate these local contacts, a NIA official said. Asked for how many months he participated in the battle on the ground, Majeed said he was completely ignored and asked to clean the toilets and arrange water for those battling with the security forces. He told the investigators that despite his immediate supervisor s request, the IS cadres did not allow him to participate in the battle. His resolve to take part in the war weakened after he was left unattended for his bullet injury for three days before being taken to a hospital, he told them. Only after I begged them, I was taken to a hospital. I was treating myself, but the injury was worsening as there was no proper medication or food available in the camps, Majeed told investigators. There was neither a holy war nor any of the preachings in the holy book were followed. IS fighters raped many a woman there, Majeed said while responding to one of the questions, an NIA official said. Admitting that he and his three friends from Kalyan underwent training on handling of AK 47 and rocket launchers, Majeed claimed the Indians were considered to be physically weak. Majeed also told interrogators that his indoctrination began after he visited an internet chat room. He was inspired to join the terrorist group and given the phone number of a person, whose men picked him up from Mosul in Iraq. The three other youths, all in their twenties, who left their Kalyan homes with Majeed to join IS were also reportedly indoctrinated through chat rooms. In the chat room, he got the number of one Abu Ali and was told to contact him only when he reached Mosul, Majeed has told his interrogators. After he joined the ISI in Iraq, he was asked to supervise construction work in their territories since he was studying civil engineering. But he expressed a desire to fight and was trained in operating AK 47s and rocket launchers. He got injured during practice and was sent to a treatment facility where he was reportedly ignored, prompting him to flee. NDTV adds that Majeed, told investigators the IS was looking east towards to India, for which it has special plans . Also he said the new world order under the IS was something everyone should fight for . Areeb s level of radicalisation is scary, a senior intelligence officer stated. The only ones who come close are the foreign terrorists, mainly from Afghanistan of the now defunct group Harkat ul Jihadi Islami, who were arrested from Jammu and Kashmir in the mid 90 s, the officer added. But investigators suspected that the IS had a motive in releasing him, that the youth had been tasked with spreading jihadi doctrine in India.	0	0	0	0

India intelligence agencies will engage with their Sri Lankan counterparts to crack down on what they describe as the “growing influence of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI)” in the region, particularly with the active support of the staff of Pakistan’s embassy in Colombo, The Asian Age reports on March 29. Top intelligence sources said there was concrete information that some Pakistani High Commission staff were using their diplomatic cover in promoting ISI’s anti India activities. “During the regime of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, there was a sense that his government was trying to form a better alliance with both China and Pakistan due to which we were slight apprehensive about discussing these issues. But now that Maithripala Sirisena has assumed charge as the new President, we feel there will be greater coordination between Indian and Sri Lankan security agencies,” a senior intelligence official said. Indian intelligence agencies have been closely monitoring activities of the ISI in Colombo, particularly after a Sri Lankan born ISI spy, was arrested in April, 2014 in Chennai (Tamil Nadu). A detailed intelligence dossier prepared by Central agencies in the wake of this incident had also warned that the future threat to India’s internal security could well come from the sea route in Sri Lanka as the ISI, assisted by Pakistani High Commission staff, was trying to increase its anti India operations there.	0	0	0	0

The Jammu and Kashmir Government on June 9 claimed that no panchayat (village level local self government institution) member has resigned, reports Deccan Herald. “Such reports are baseless and mischievous. Chief Minister (Omar Abdullah) has taken up the issue of threats issued by unknown elements against panchayat members with the security agencies,” said Ali Mohammad Sagar, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj. “I am the concerned minister and I can tell you we have not received any resignations from any panchayat member whatsoever,” he added. Sagar also said the government has asked Police to take necessary measures to find out the truth behind the threats and ensure safety and security of panchayat members. As reported earlier, media reports had indicated that at least half a dozen panchayat members had resigned from their posts announcing it through paid advertisements in vernacular dailies after militant threats. Meanwhile, the Government has reportedly put a very strong mechanism in place to check the activities of mischievous elements who were responsible for resignations (though not official) of about half a dozen Panchayat members in the Kashmir valley and ensure that the trend was completely curbed. There was no specific reason and common reason behind half a dozen Panches issuing resignation letters in the newspapers instead of giving them to the concerned authorities , official sources said. Director General of Police (DGP) K Rajendra confirmed that a security mechanism has been put in place all across the State, not confining it to the Kashmir Valley where some resignations have been reported, to ensure that not only the Sarpanches and Panches have a free, safe and secure environment but the common man also. We will get to bottom of the conspiracy. Who are the people behind it (the resignations) Who have sponsored the conspirators At who behest the posters or threatening letters to the Panchayat members have been issued We will go into the roots and come up with a detailed report very soon’’, Rajendra said. The DGP admitted that night police patrolling was being revived in some sensitive areas, where it had been stopped earlier due to peaceful environment. The patrolling has proved quite successful. The trend of any fresh resignation has stopped. Still, we have to go into roots of the problem and find out reasons for the resignations, though they were very small in numbers’’, Rajendra added.	0	0	0	0
The Border Security Force (BSF) has gunned down 15 Pakistan Rangers personnel and destroyed their two dozen Observation Towers and Border out Posts (BoPs)besides causing huge destruction to their set ups in the PoK Pakistan occupied Kashmir during the week, Daily Excelsior reported on October 28. Additional Director General of BSF Arun Kumar said the BSF has killed 15 Pakistani Rangers since the tensions flared up along the International Border (IB). He said several Observation Towers and BoPs of the Rangers have been razed to ground or damaged extensively in retaliatory firing by the BSF. Asserting that the way Pakistan shelling and firing was on, it was clear indication that the Pakistan Army has taken over the posts from the Rangers. “Firing and kind of ammunition used by Pakistan indicated that it was not their Rangers but army, which was firing upon Indian posts and forward locations,” he said. Kumar said the BSF has lost its third soldier after the sniping incident at Bobiya Post in Hiranagar sector of Kathua District in which Gurnam Singh was martyred followed by head constable Sushil Kumar and now Jatinder Singh, both of whom were killed at Abdullian in RS Pura. Three other BSF jawans have been injured, he added.Official sources said that Army has devised a new strategy to counter shelling from Pakistan side to save civilian population and own losses. The Army was now targeting and decimating Pakistani posts, which were raining mortars on civilian population. “Our troops are now going for the kill. They are decimating the posts of the Army across LoC Line of Control in Nowshera, Sunderbani, Mendhar, Balakote, Mankote and Tarkundi in twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, which were worst hit by mortar shelling, to avoid civilian casualties. After decimating the Pakistani posts, the Army was not allowing Pakistani troops to re construct the posts by engaging them. In number of areas, the Pakistan army jawans have been either killed or injured when their posts were decimated while others have run far behind for cover,” sources said, adding this strategy of the troops has saved many civilian lives as they were targeting civilian population with heavy mortars and automatic weapons. This way, sources confirmed, a number of Pakistani Posts have been completely destroyed and Pakistani troops have abandoned those areas as there was no other cover for them. The shelling in some of the villages has stopped after decimation of these posts, they said.	0	0	0	0

the UCPN M said that there is no meaning in demanding resignation of the PM as the government has already turned into a caretaker. Hinting at the Nepali Congress (NC) and the CPN UML, the party also said that there is a serious conspiracy to impose the parliamentary system in the country, sabotaging the agenda of the Constituent Assembly (CA). Newly appointed UCPN M spokesperson Agni Sapkota said, After political parties forge consensus on a candidate, the President can appoint him her prime minister, removing any difficulties. He also said that the five point agreement signed by the parties on May 3, 2012, was no longer relevant with the dissolution of the CA on May 27. Accordingly, the NC alone could not claim leadership of the government but that it was open to all parties, including the Maoists. Sapkota said the Maoist party was open to either revival of the CA or fresh elections. However, our bottom line is that a new constitution should be drafted through the CA, said Sapkota. He said that there should be an agreement on contentious issues of the new constitution.

The Government and the Army both saw the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as an existential threat to their State and were committed to dealing with it, the commander of US and international forces in Afghanistan informed Congress on March 12, reports Dawn. General Joseph Dunford also told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was committed to talks with the TTP but its not clear if conditions were right for a constructive engagement with the TTP. At a hearing on the current situation in Afghanistan, General Dunford said the US military could wait till August for a bilateral security agreement with Kabul after which it would start preparing for a withdrawal from that country, if a pact was not signed. During the hearing, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked the general to explain how the situation in Pakistan could affect what happens in Afghanistan. I find it difficult to envision success in the region without cooperation of Pakistan and without an effective relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan, General Dunford said. I believe that Pakistan also recognises the existential threat of extremism to their own security, and they also recognise that its not in their best interest to have anything other than a stable, secure and unified Afghanistan. He noted that since August, Pakistani and Afghan rulers had met four times, indicating that Prime Minister Sharif had come to a new resolve to improve the relationship with the neighbouring country. This cooperation focused on two areas to have a common definition of extremism and cooperate on dealing with it and to come up with a broader border management framework that would address the political, economic and security issues between the two countries, he added.	0	0	0	0

Police officers of the four provinces and Gilgit Baltistan told the Senate Standing Committee on Interior on August 21 that the crime was becoming organised as various criminal groups had associated themselves with terrorist organisations like the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). “We are heading for a situation like Mexico where drug lords and street criminals are operating like a corporate firm,” said a senior official of the National Police Bureau. “The more serious problem in Pakistan is that terrorists and anti state elements are getting aligned with all kinds of criminals.” Senator Shahi Syed of the Awami National Party alleged that terrorist organisations like the TTP and BLA operated with the help of local criminals in Lyari and other parts of Karachi. “It may look odd but we have seen it. If you catch a small fish involved in crime his backing comes from the TTP whose field operators in Karachi are criminals belonging to Waziristan or Afghanistan,” he said. Shahi Syed even accused personnel of Intelligence Agencies, Rangers and Police of conniving with criminals. He cited an example that persons belonging to a terror outfit came to the forefront after complaints were lodged to the officers of an Intelligence Agency against some criminals.

Conflict victims have become concerned about preparations to remove ‘crime against humanity’ from the heinous crime category in the amendment draft bill of the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Act, which is being tabled in the Parliament soon, reports The Himalayan Timeson September 27. Attorney General Raman Kumar Shrestha accepted that homework was on to amend the exiting CIEDP and TRC Act, by removing ‘crime against humanity’ from the heinous crime category. Suman Adhikari, chairman, Conflict Victims Common Platform on Transitional Justice Nepal, said that ‘crime against humanity’ shouldn’t be de listed from the category of heinous crimes. Rather, it should be clarified what sort of crimes fall under ‘heinous crime’. “In the existing Act, crime against humanity is considered a heinous crime. We shouldn’t remove it from the Act, rather it should be defined clearly,” Adhikari said. He also said other crimes such as forcible use of children in the insurgency, should also be considered a serious crime that happened in the decade long Maoist insurgency from February 1996 to November 2006. In the existing CIEDP and TRC Act, crime against humanity is termed a heinous crime, along with rape, killing, torture and enforced disappearances. The draft has classified crimes other than these four heinous crimes as ‘other crimes’, by providing space for general amnesty to the perpetrators. The proposed amendment bill is awaiting final endorsement from the Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs to be able in the House.	0	0	0	0

Nagaland State Chief Minister, TR Zeliang on September 22 stated that, the fencing of border areas in the North East may not find as much logic as it does in border areas with Pakistan and parts of Bangladesh, since in the case of Nagaland “the international boundary does not follow a river or other convenient landmarks” but rather, based on the “watershed principles”, reports Morung Express. While addressing the Northeast Connectivity Summit at Agartala in Tripura, he pointed out the case of the house of the Angh in Longwa village in Mon District where half of it lies in India and the other half in Myanmar. “In fact, what we need is not barbed wire fencing, but construction of roads along and across the borders so as to “unlock the land locked areas”, and promote trade and development, Zeliang said.

One of the handlers of the November 26, 2008 (26 11) Mumbai attacks and arrested Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) operative Abu Jundals internet protocol (IP) addresses will be access by the Police officials to ascertain the fact that he communicated with his fellow terrorists through email when he was on the run and was in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, said a police officer, reports Times of India on August 2. The crime branch of the police has applied for a letter Rogatory (LR) to be issued to a US court so that it may seek information from Google and Yahoo about the online activities of 26 11 accused Zabiuddin Ansari, alias Abu Jundal. One of the officers interrogating Jundal said the police want information about nine email accounts and one Face book profile used by the terrorist. Jundal has told the police he used these to be in touch with his LeT handlers and mentors (Faiyaz Kagzi, Aslam Kashmiri, Abu Junaid and Shaukat). Meanwhile, Abu Jundal revealed that one of the key participants in the preparation of the 26 11 terror strike, another top Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) commander, Abu al Kafa, had apprised Headley of the five targets in Mumbai. Abu al Kafa had briefed US national David Coleman Headley about the sites in Mumbai to be recced for the attack. Kafas name first surfaced during the interrogation of captured 26 11 attacker Ajmal Amir Kasab, who had reportedly revealed that Kafa, an expert in handling arms and explosives, had trained them and was one of the LeT commanders who came to see them off at Karachi harbour. The crime branch suspects that if Jundals claims are true, It is not possible for Kafa, a LeT commander largely confined to the terror camps, to know the location and topography of the targets, especially a place like Chabad House which was not even known to the locals in Colaba before it came under attack. As reported earlier, Jundal was arrested on June 21, 2012, by Delhi Police at New Delhi s Indira Gandhi International Airport after being deported from Saudi Arabia.	0	0	0	0

The number of terrorist attacks each year has more than quadrupled in the decade since September 11, 2001, a study released by Global Terrorism Index published on December 4 by the US and Australia based Institute for Economics and Peace think tank said, with Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan the most affected, reports Daily Times. The number of annual deaths in attacks, however, peaked in 2007 the height of the Iraq conflict and has been falling ever since. The survey reported 7,473 fatalities in 2011, 25 percent down on 2007. That figure included dead suicide bombers and other attackers. Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Yemen were the five countries most affected by terrorism in descending order, it said, based on a measure giving weightings to number of attacks, fatalities and injuries and level of property damage. The Global Terrorism Index ranked countries based on data from the Global Terrorism Database run by a consortium based at the University of Maryland, a commonly used reference by security researchers. The US military interventions pursued as part of the Wests anti al Qaeda war on terror, the researchers suggested, may have simply made matters worse while whether they made the US homeland safer was impossible to prove. After 9 11, terrorist activity fell back to pre 2000 levels until after the Iraq invasion, and has since escalated dramatically, Steve Killelea, founder and executive chairman of the Institute for Economics and Peace, told Reuters in an e mail interview. Iraq accounts for about a third of all terrorist deaths over the last decade, and Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan account for over 50 percent of fatalities. The study says terrorism incidents numbered 982 in 2002, causing 3,823 deaths, rising to 4,564 terrorist incidents globally in 2011, resulting in 7,473 deaths. The researchers used the University of Maryland definition of terrorism the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.	0	0	0	0

National Investigation Agency (NIA) has tracked the source of funds utilised in Bardhaman (West Bengal ) blast of October 2, 2014 to sustain the Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) modules in India, The Times of India reports on November 14. The agency has identified a man named Abdul Noor, suspected to be a key operative of the outfit in Bangladesh, as the man who carried cash tranches across the border periodically. NIA has also identified a JMB operative from West Bengal who was working as a mason in Jammu and Kashmir. The man has already been interrogated by the agency. The agency has also found that not only did all members have wives who were equally involved in all terror acts but the top brass among the Indian module had more than one wife who were all engaged in terror activities. In fact, marriages were deliberately solemnised among members of the module much on the lines of Maoists. Women were, however, given training only in firing of weapons and not in making of bombs. This is a unique development as far as jihadi terrorism in India is concerned. The JMB module in India has 50 per cent women. All have been indoctrinated, well trained in physical combat and weapon operation and married to their jihadi colleagues, said an NIA officer.	0	0	0	0

Outgoing Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) director general (DG) Dilip Trivedi on November 27 made serious allegations of Maoism benefitting Naxal Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected states, reports The Times of India. In a question answer session with journalists, when asked about lack of participation from states in fighting Naxals, Trivedi said, For some states, continuing Naxal violence is beneficial. It helps them get central funds. And then it s not their men who die but those from outside the state (central force personnel). Sources said the DG was hinting at Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha. While speaking on how the force was dealing with Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts, Trivedi said, The easier way of fighting IEDs is to ensure Maoists do not get explosives easily. But the government is not serious about regulation of explosives sale. State governments have to stop explosives from reaching Maoists. Asked whether he thought even CRPF needed a special law, like Armed Force Special Power Act (AFSPA), given that it was working in fairly hostile and tough conditions, Trivedi said, We don t need AFSPA. The CrPC provides enough protection to forces fighting militants. India already has too many laws. When quizzed on why he had refused to participate on two committees set up to restructure CRPF, Trivedi narrated a long story, summing up that committees were a waste of public money and government time. He also said the government had spent huge amounts of money conducting Indian Institute of Management (IIM) studies on problems of the force to arrive at conclusions that they force already knew. They could have just asked us. But the problem is we are not consulted. Consultants are hired who charge lakhs of rupees, said Trivedi.	0	0	0	0

As the focus of security agencies, has been to neutralize the activities of Lashker e Toiba (LeT) in Sopore town (Baramulla District) of Jammu and Kashmir (J K), it is the Kashmir’s oldest militant outfit Hizb ul Mujahideen (HM) which can prove to be a bigger threat in the coming times, Deccan Herald reports on April 27. According to sources LeT is receiving major setback due to killing and arrest of its top commanders, the focus of security agencies is likely to shift to HM. Police sources believe that conspiracy for most of the attacks is done in Sopore because it is easier for the militants to receive logistic support locally. HM has built a strong network in Sopore and its adjoining areas. “Hizb has seven Pakistan trained local militants and dozens of over ground workers (OGWs) in the town…Police have little or no knowledge about the activities of HM and its operation chief Qayoom Najar alias Jan sahib,” sources added. An unnamed senior Police officer told that HM has carried out most of the killings of Panchayat (village level local self government institution) members in north Kashmir in past one year. He described HM as more dangerous than the LeT due to its indigenous character.“People support HM militants more as the outfit draws its cadres primarily from indigenous Kashmiris. Another reason for HM’s resurgence is that it is very close to both the Jamaat e Islami (JeI) in Kashmir and Pakistan due to which it has lot of sources and resources to sustain for a longer time,” he added. The officer said the HM cadres are dedicated and claim to have support within the system. “Jamaat e Islami has a strong support base within the police, bureaucracy and judiciary due to which tracking HM militants is tougher than those of LeT,” he claimed.	0	0	0	0

Dawood Ibrahim has built his empire with associates from India, Pakistan, and the Gulf, The Hindu reports on December 8. Dawood has major investment in the 3200 hectare self contained Dubai Investment Park and in a high rise building in UAE Marina. According to recent reports, the high rise building on the Marina may be facing legal troubles. He also has plots and other investments in the UAE, a federation of seven emirates in the Persian Gulf.

Police said that six rebels on bikes abducted Ajay Kumar Singh (30) and Raju Kerketta (19) at gunpoint from Bondekera village, around 75km from the district headquarters, around 6pm. The incident took place when the duos, both residents of Bondekera village, were returning from a local market. The suspected PLFI cadres then took them away into the deep forests and shot them from point blank range.

The Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) acts as a catalytic agent to help the Northeast (NE) based groups to get a foothold in Jaigaon town in the newly formed Alipurduar District of West Bengal, reports The New Indian Express on July 26.The KLO has organised several meetings here between NE groups and Maoists from Nepal, Jamaat e Islami Bangladesh, Jamaat ul Mujahideen Bangladesh and even the ISI. The ISI is very much active just across the border in Phuentsholling, a sleepy town in Bhutan. The entire operation of liasoning with insurgent groups is supervised by KLO leader Nityananda alias Jamai. The new equation between terrorist organisations from Nepal and Bangladesh with those in the northeast and West Bengal has come to the attention of Indian intelligence agencies. The JMB, in exchange for safe passage, is providing arms and ammunition to the KLO. After infiltrating through Assam, the JMB militants would move to other Districts of West Bengal. A cold war between the Police Forces of Assam and West Bengal also help them. Neither of the two police forces informs and alerts each other, leading to lack of coordination. As such, we are finding it difficult to trace their movements. There is a clear cut instruction from the Ministry of Home Affairs to exchange information about any person entering from Bangladesh. The JMB terrorists infiltrate to Kokrajhar and Dhubri in Assam and then seek shelter in Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar in West Bengal. Through their network, they reach other districts of Bengal and sometimes through Birbhum flee to Jharkhand.

India on November 3 (today) said at UN General Assembly that its citizens have faced repeated inhuman terror attacks by proxies of Pakistan, which continues to abuse the concept of self determination to bolster territorial aggrandizement against it, reports Deccan Chronicle. Pakistan, whose own people have been deprived of their democratic rights for most of its history and which continues to illegally occupy a part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and rules it as a virtual colony, repeatedly indulges in the abuse of the concept of self determination to bolster its agenda of territorial aggrandizement through terrorism against India, Counsellor in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Mayank Joshi said at a General Assembly session on the Right of people to self determination . Strongly rejecting Pakistan s ritual propaganda on the right to self determination and the baseless allegations made by it, Joshi said India is the world s largest democracy and free and fair elections are held regularly in Jammu and Kashmir meeting the aspiration of its people. The truth is that thousands of innocent citizens of India, including women and children, continue to fall victim to the repeated inhuman terrorist attacks committed by proxies of the State of Pakistan in our region, Joshi said.He stressed that India has repeatedly pointed out that Pakistan would serve its people better if only it could introspect about the challenges faced by its society instead of setting sights on territories of their neighbours in flagrant violation of all international norms of behaviour . He added, By now the international community has seen through these misleading attempts by Pakistan. We therefore do not intend to engage any further on this issue.	0	0	0	0

An Indian terror module pledging allegiance to the Islamic State (IS ISIS) is a reorganized group of the virtually defunct Indian Mujahideen (IM) and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) elements, recruiting new members to carry out a string of terror strikes across the country, highly placed intelligence sources said, reports The Shillong Times on January 30. This fact came out during the questioning of 14 suspected Islamic State (IS) sympathisers who were arrested last week from 12 places in six cities in a synchronized raid conducted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the sources added. Those inspired by the IS ideology were hooked by Yusuf al Hind who, the Indian security agencies believe, is former IM member Shafi Armar, a resident of Bhatkal in Karnataka. Armar, now believed to be in the Islamic State held area along the border of Iraq and Syria, formed ‘Janood ul Khalifa e Hind’ and recruited Mumbai based 33 year old Mudabbir Mushtaq Shaikh as ‘Amir’ (chief) of the group. Official sources privy to the investigation said that Armar also recruited his brother Sultan and others who had worked for IM and the now banned SIMI. “Apart from former IM and SIMI members, Armar chose those who are basically inspired by the IS ideology. He first recruited his close aides and then inspired them to recruit more supporters,” said an unnamed official. They used social networking sites and made calls through the internet (using VoIP Voice over Internet Protocol) to activate the sleeper cells of IM and SIMI,” the official added.Another intelligence source declining to be identified said that the outfit members were directed to carry out strikes across multiple cities, including Hyderabad in Telangana, Bengaluru, Mangalore and Tumkur in Karnataka, Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, and Aurangabad and Mumbai in Maharashtra. “They were asked to organise training camps like how to use fire arms before the attack. They were also trying to establish channels for procuring explosives and weapons,” the official source said. The leadership of Janood ul Khalifa e Hind, active since April 2015, was following the IM and SIMI set ups by choosing their organised central, state and city level core groups, the official said. The 14 men, allegedly influenced by IS and arrested by the NIA, are also said to have revealed that the 20 year old Uttar Pradesh based Mohammed Aleem was chosen as Naib Amir, the second in command of the group after Mudabbir. The sources said Karnataka resident Najmul Huda was the military commander and 24 year old Hyderabadi Mohammed Nafees Khan was the finance chief of the outfit.	0	0	0	0

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on January 9 voiced concern at the reports of a number of journalists facing threats in recent weeks and asked the authorities to ensure that threats to journalists end, reports Daily Times. A statement issued in Lahore District by HRCP said, “The HRCP is alarmed at reports of threats received by journalists on account of their work. While it is not uncommon for journalists in Pakistan to live under a constant cloud of intimidation and violence, the perceptible increase in threats is manifested by over a dozen journalists killed in 2011, while many others have been forced to go into hiding. Many have exercised self censorship for the sake of safety and others have suffered for airing views that are unpopular in some quarters. A number of journalists have recently gone public about the threats they have received from ‘anonymous callers’. They have also mentioned cell phone numbers of the callers but little has been done to identify or prosecute these people. A Government committed to media freedom must neither remain a spectator in the circumstances nor wait to be implored into action.” Further the report stated, “HRCP wants to remind the authorities that for two years now Pakistan has held the dubious distinction of being one of the deadliest countries for journalists. HRCP reiterates that those making threats and perpetrating violence against journalists are encouraged by the fact that out of over 70 journalists killed in Pakistan in the last decade, the perpetrators have been brought to justice in only one case.” HRCP urged all state institutions to acknowledge the dangers faced by the journalists, identify and prosecute those threatening media persons on account of their work and ensure that journalism does not remain a dangerous profession in Pakistan.	0	0	0	0

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has not been able to conduct substantive investigations into conflict related complaints due to delay by the Government in amending a crucial Act, reports My Republica on November 19. Though the Government has been claiming that the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) and TRC Act would be amended soon by incorporating the verdicts of the Supreme Court (SC) on transitional justice, the Government has yet to bring an amendment bill in parliament. The original term of the commission expires on February 10. On the other hand, commissioners at the TRC also lament that they are facing a funds crunch as their proposals are stuck in red tape at the Ministry of Finance. The commission receives funds only after its programs are sanctioned by the ministry. From the very first day, we asked the government for regulations. It took almost a year to finalize the regulations. We have also been asking for amendment to the existing Act but we are still unaware where the amendment process is stuck. On the other hand, the commission s every financial proposal for taking forward the investigation has to be endorsed by the Ministry of Finance and this takes time, said Shrikrishna Subedi, a commissioner at the TRC. The commission has received 57,753 complaints from the victims of the insurgency. Although the existing Act allows the commission to recommend extension of its one year tenure, settling all 57,753 complaints within a year s time looks almost impossible. The commission has so far received 6,290 complaints from Province 1; 3,802 from Province 2; 7,508 from Province 3; 3,637 from Province 4; 16,343 from Province 5; 10,315 from Province 6; and 9,858 from Province 7.

Accusing Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) of using the Haqqani network to carry out a “proxy war”, US on September 21 warned Islamabad to cut ties with the terror group and help eliminate its leaders or it will act unilaterally, reports Indian Express. The US administration has indicated that the US will act unilaterally if Pakistan does not comply, The Washington Post reported. Quoting officials, the paper said the message was delivered in high level meetings and public statements over the past several days reflecting Washington’s view that the year long strategy of using persuasion and military assistance to influence Pakistan’s behaviour has been ineffective. Meanwhile, a US Senate committee voted to make economic and security aid to Pakistan conditional on its cooperation in fighting militants. The Senate committee did not specify any amount for economic aid to Pakistan for fiscal 2012, leaving it up to the Obama administration to set the level and notify Congress or provide nothing at all. If the administration wants to provide zero, that d be OK with us, said Republican Senator Mark Kirk, one of the more vocal critics of Pakistan on the panel. The committee did approve USD 1 billion for the Pakistan Counter insurgency Capability Fund, which was created in 2009 to help Pakistan s military develop counter insurgency capabilities to fight Islamist militants within its borders. But the committee voted to make this aid, as well as any economic aid that is provided, conditional on Pakistan s cooperating with Washington against several militant groups. The restrictions were part of a foreign aid bill that the committee approved and sent to the Senate floor. It will have to be reconciled with the House of Representatives, where lawmakers in one subcommittee have voted similar restrictions. Pakistan also gets US military aid via the Pentagon budget. But Washington is already withholding USD 800 million of that aid this year as ties have come under mounting strain. Washington has allocated about USD 20 billion for Pakistan over the last decade. In fiscal 2010, Congress approved USD 1.7 billion for economic aid for Pakistan, and USD 2.7 billion in security aid, the Congressional Research Service says.	0	0	0	0

According to an official data of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), of the Finance Ministry, more than 54,000 Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) have been received by the agency during the said period which may have connections with illegal and criminal funds. These reports were sent to the FIU by private and public sector banks, financial intermediaries and other financial institutions under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Planning to approach the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the listing of Jaish e Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, India has lashed out at the UN’s action plan on the “lack of single contact point” in preventing violent extremism, Indian Express reports on February 16. India’s Permanent Representative at the UN in New York, Syed Akbaruddin, who was speaking on the Secretary General’s report on ‘Preventing Violent Extremism’, at the UN General Assembly, said, “Our view (is) that the current architecture at the UN is not sufficient to tackle this virus that threatens us collectively. The action plan provides no solution to this shortcoming. For example, where is the single contact point that will assist member states seeking United Nations assistance in preventing violent extremism? Having gone through the entire action plan, unfortunately, we did not find an answer to this simple and basic question.”India’s position is that while the action plan is “full of prescriptions” to member countries, it is low on what the UN will do in terms of assisting member states in this venture. Akbaruddin told the UNGA that India acknowledges addressing this “malaise” is primarily a member state’s responsibility. “Nevertheless, we need substantive value addition from the UN. Even more important than what we face is how we respond to the threat,” he said. “What we are tackling is not merely a local problem that can be addressed unilaterally; it is a global contagion. Global links, franchise relations, home grown terrorism and use of cyber space for recruitment and propaganda. All these present a new level of threat. We need significant options of international cooperation, which we do not discern in the plan before us today.”	0	0	0	0

Agency reports said the first RPG was fired around 3.45am. ITBP Director General (DG) Subhash Goswami said, One of the fidayeen was killed by one of our constables while he was trying to scale the consulate wall. The other three terrorists entered an adjacent building and were neutralized by the Afghan forces. None of our jawans or the consulate staff was injured. Goswami said a general alert regarding a possible attack on consulates in Afghanistan had been received by the force a few weeks ago. We recently reinforced our strength by 79 more men in the country in view of the threats, said Goswami. India s Ambassador to Afghanistan Amar Sinha said there were nine Indians in the mission apart from local Afghans at the time of the attack. They fired a couple of RPG shots. It was dark and they couldn t verify where it was coming from, said Sinha. Moreover, recoveries made from one of the fidayeens showed that they had supplies for at least three days and enough arsenals to completely destroy the consulate. ITBP personnel, who repelled the attack killing one of the fidayeens while he was trying to scale the consulate wall, have found that each fidayeen carried dry fruit packets that could help him survive two three days. Apart from this each carried one AK 47 gun with Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL), six magazines, 17 rocket propelled grenades and four hand grenades. Had they gained entry, with such massive ammunition, they could have completely destroyed the consulate, said a senior ITBP officer.

Husain Haqqani, Pakistan s Ambassador to Washington, on August 11 accused the United States (US) of alienating Pakistanis by coming into the country in a military fashion “with guns blazing” to conduct the unilateral raid that killed Osama bin Laden in his Abbottabad hideout on May 1, reported Indian Express.

Rediff on January 1 reported that the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) in the past two years, since 2010 ‘uprising’, has managed to rope in nearly 70 recruits mostly in the age group of 20 and 25. Intelligence officials say that the main trouble they face is that the newer recruits are locals of the Valley. They have better understanding of the terrain which makes their hiding and escape easier. The new recruits have been tracked through a missing persons chart prepared by the Jammu and Kashmir Police. These persons have gone missing since the past two years. While many have been taken to Pakistan for training, several other have already joined the LeT and are engaged in a battle against India. Sources in the Intelligence Bureau have said that the 2010 ‘uprising’ in Kashmir has started to show its effects today. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in 2010 had put out a warning that the escalation of violence in the region was being fuelled by the LeT through its cronies. A majority of the stone pelters during that ‘uprising’ were found to be LeT cadres who continued their battle against security agencies.	0	0	0	0

The infiltration of militants into Kashmir valley has gone up this year despite Army being on high alert along the Line of Control (LoC) and militants are making desperate attempts to sneak in even after surgical strikes conducted by Special Forces of Army in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) last month, reports Daily Excelsior on October 17. According to MultiAgency Centre (MAC) figures, 83 militants, mostly belonging to LashkareToiba (LeT), have infiltrated into Kashmir this year till August while last year the number was 35 for the whole year. However, a senior security force officer said that it is a conservative estimate and the figure could be higher than official figure as since July 8, after the killing of HizbulMujahideen (HM) ‘commander’, Burhan Wani, the security agencies are not getting accurate picture about recently infiltrated militants. The officer said that some of the recently infiltrated groups are yet to come under Security Forces (SFs) radar. Some of these militants are still in North Kashmir’s forest areas near the LoC while others have managed to reach the hinterland unnoticed. The infiltration attempts are still going on despite the surgical strikes against the militant launch pads in PoK at Dudniyal in Kail, Neelam, Leepa, Bhimber and Tata Pani. At Dudniyal in Kail area, the LeT suffered major damage where lot of their cadre who were planning to infiltrate were killed. Sources said that despite the surgical strikes the militant training camps are still active in PoK with 19 of them most active including those at Skardu, Kel, Karko, Dullu, Titwal, Chakoti, Kotli, Dehri, Barhal Mirpur and Chaprai. In these training camps, the militants are receiving rigorous training besides map reading, global positioning system (GPS) use, weight, weapon and tactical training. They said that over 200 militants are still waiting at launch pads for infiltration before the onset of winter but now they are alert. The militant leaders want to push in more infiltrators this year ahead of winter as security forces achieved major success against militants this year by eliminating over 115 of them so far. Army has intensified its vigil along the LoC and already two Brigades of Army have been sent to LoC in North Kashmir to take on the infiltrated militants and one more Brigade of Army has been sent to South Kashmir after increased militancy in the area. Militants taking advantage of the unrest have recruited locals into militancy and have activated their Over Ground Workers (OGWs) as well. The involvement of locals into militancy is a major challenge for the security agencies.	0	0	0	0

The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is looking at an advanced mine detection system used by the western forces in Afghanistan, to tackle Improvised Explosive Device (IED) threats in Left wing extremism hit areas, The Times of India reports on August 21. IED attacks account for a major chunk of casualties suffered by the counter Naxal forces. Stressing the need for employing the latest technology to defeat IED menace, the MHA has, in its latest action plan to fight Left wing extremism, proposed mine detector AN PSS 14, developed by US based L3 Cyterra and used widely in Afghanistan, for the counter Naxal grid. It has recommended that Institute of IED Management at Pune managed by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) be asked to study the system and make suggestions. The action plan also seeks better LWE solutions from low intensity conflict division of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Among the other important ideas included in the proposed LWE action plan are state level monitoring committees, comprising officers from the State Government, State Police, Union Home Ministry and Central para military forces to review progress of anti Maoist operations on a monthly basis. Also, the plan calls for focus on 35 40 worse affected districts, where competent IAS IPS officers may be posted. Officers who do well in the four years may be rewarded with preferential postings, foreign deputations and foreign courses. Taking a leaf out of Punjab s success in beating Sikh militancy, the action plan seeks experimenting with a single IG DIG exercising command over both the state police and Central forces to ensure better coordination and response against the Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist). Besides, the plan suggests placing inter state border junctions in select places like Jamui Giridih and Sukma Malkangiri under the jurisdiction of DIG commandants of Central forces. It is to be seen how states view this suggestion, law and order being their exclusive domain. Projecting road connectivity as a game changer, the Centre has suggested insurance subsidy for contractors, workers and machinery as well as incentivising timely completion of projects. A revised surrender policy and a cabinet sub committee to expedite compensation to LWE victims, doubling of expenditure limit for civic action programes to INR 2 million and distribution of free TVs to residents of remote Naxal hit villages are some of the other measures proposed to make the fight against LWE more effective. Importantly, the action plan endorses Kerala s demand for a Counter Insurgency and Anti Terrorist Training facility, taking note of Maoists plans to revive their south west zonal committee at the Kerala Tamil Nadu Karnataka border.	0	0	0	0

Based on an intelligence report, transactions in these accounts have been put on hold. Police suspect the money deposited belonged to the Naxals and that the latter is using the bank accounts of other people to escape the demonetisation drive.Special Director General (Naxal Operations and Special Intelligence Bureau) Durgesh Madhav Awasthi told “We have issued an instruction that after demonetisation. The Naxals will bring out huge hoarded money buried in the ground for mobilisation in a bid to save it from becoming illegal tender. They are applying the two way approach to save their money first, they are returning old money to their contractors and asking them to provide new currencies after getting it converted; secondly, they are using their rural and urban networks to deposit their money in banks.” “We are getting such information from all eight Naxal hit districts. In the last three to four days, we have identified people in whose accounts money was deposited, and have sent their names to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Collector and banks, asking them to stop transactions in such accounts till it is established that the deposited money belongs to account holders. The depositors will themselves speak about the source of money. It is also possible, in some cases, that money belongs to the depositors,” he said. “However, as per information, Maoists have deposited big amounts in the accounts of people having very little transactions or having ‘Jan Dhan’ accounts. I have instructed Superintendents of Police and bank officials to inquire into such accounts. More than 50 accounts have been traced so far, but their numbers are increasing. We have information of Rs. 15 20 crore being deposited in such accounts,” he added.	0	0	0	0

This could be reversed if there are financial rewards for them but unfortunately there is no channel to do so,” he added.	0	0	0	0

The island nation saw a brutal civil war between the government and Tamil Tigers Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE . The latter sought to create an independent state in the predominantly Tamil provinces of northern and eastern Sri Lanka. These areas bore the brunt of 30 years of bloody civil war between the army and rebels, and the civil war ended with the rebels defeat. NAFSO coordinator Lavina Hasanthi told Asia News that the overall picture of the situation is still incomplete because many displaced people are not registered at refugee camps. Some in fact prefer to live in makeshift tents near their original home. NAFSO president Herman Kumara, a special guest from the World Forum for Fisher People (WFFP), told Asia News that 55 per cent of those living in the camps do not have electricity, and 70 per cent do not have access to clean water. He also noted that lavatories are almost non existent, and where they do exist, they are off limits at night. As human rights activists, all we can hope for is for our fellow citizens to lead a life based on dignity, he said. We anticipate that displaced people will go back to a normal life, on their land, revive their culture so as to contribute to the countrys economy. Above all, we want to see them get out of their currently subhuman conditions and start to lead a decent living.	0	0	0	0

Outgoing General Officer Commanding (GOC, 15 Corps), Lieutenant General Syed Atta Hasnain on June 8, said that it is impossible to bring infiltration to zero level in Kashmir valley, according to Daily Excelsior. There is no force in the world that can bring the infiltration to zero level… it is never possible for us to bring the graph of infiltration level to zero level. Like the previous years, some incidents of infiltration have taken place but the number of attempts has definitely come down, said General Hasnain. He said that some incidents of infiltration have remained un reported adding that the infiltration attempts made in strategically important areas get coverage in the media. Usually the infiltration that takes place in the Uri sector gets media coverage while as occurrence of such incidents at other places do not find a place in media. We established contact with militants at some other places and even yesterday an infiltration attempt was foiled. He said that infiltration usually takes place in April and May adding that this year 2012 as the winter has been prolonged the attempts of infiltration may take place in June as well. He said Sopore, Baramulla, Kupwara and other areas of North Kashmir have direct impact of the infiltration attempts since they fall in vicinity of the Line of Control (LoC). Hasnain said that 300 militants are operating in the Kashmir Valley and that most of them are operating in North Kashmir. He also said that militants are trying to regroup in South Kashmir especially in Pulwama District. We have reduced the night patrolling in the areas of South Kashmir and this may be the reason that militancy has been revived to some extent in South Kashmir especially in the Pulwama district. We are working in collaboration with Jammu and Kashmir Police and over the next two weeks we would be able to wipe militants who have come up yet again, said Hasnain. He further said that militants have changed their strategy and they are using cars for planting bombs. He said the car bomb blast at Bijbehara along with the recovery of explosives laden car from Chanapora area in Srinagar are significant reminders about this development on the militant front. There are enough explosives with the militants operating in the Kashmir valley although the weaponry is less. It is quite possible that the militants may strengthen their ranks in Kashmir in the months to come. As such it is important to notice their movements and take steps that would defeat their designs, said Hasnain.	0	0	0	0

The six communities have been in talks with the government for ST status for a long time and we will try to make sure that the issues are taken up jointly for an early resolution, Hazarika, who walked out of jail on bail in 2008, said.Tai Ahom, Moran, Muttock, Sutia, Koch Rajbongshi and the tea tribes have been demanding the Centre to accord ST status mainly because migration from neighbouring Bangladesh has posed serious threat to their indigenous identity and culture.

The Sindh Government on July 19 moved to consolidate its position amid the ongoing debate on its strained relations with the Pakistan Rangers when Chief Minister (CM) Syed Qaim Ali Shah insisted that the paramilitary force was given powers only to establish peace in Karachi and not to operate in the whole province, reports Dawn. He also said that “investigations” were going on to determine whether the paramilitary force had moved beyond its power in the Asad Kharal affair in Larkana. The CM’s stance emerged challenging the paramilitary force’s viewpoint about the powers as Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, Director General Major General Bilal Akbar had asserted only a few days ago that Rangers could move in any part of the province to chase criminals using their special powers given under the defined laws. “One should say that the Rangers are here to assist the police in maintaining law and order,” he said while speaking at a press conference in Larkana. “The Rangers were given powers for four heinous crimes — terrorism, targeted killing, extortion and kidnapping for ransom. They were authorised under certain circumstance to curb these crimes. Furthermore, they were given powers to operate only in Karachi and not in the entire province.”Earlier, the Federal Minister of Interior Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan wrote a letter to the Sindh CM, asking him to extend the policing powers of Rangers in the province, adds Dawn. “Unnecessary delay in extension of power to Rangers in Sindh will not only disrupt operation against terrorists but also negatively impact the morale and performance of the civil armed forces,” the minister said. The policing powers of the paramilitary force in Sindh, last extended on May 4 for 77 days, expire on July 21. The deployment of Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, in Karachi is requisitioned under Article 147 of the Constitution and Clause 1 of Sub section 3 of Section 4 of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, authorising the paramilitary force to prevent the commission of terrorist acts or scheduled offences in the notified area for the punishment of terrorists in accordance with the provision of the ATA, 1997.	0	0	0	0

Concerned over purported Islamic State (IS) video threatening to unleash terror in the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Police launched a massive exercise to counter any terror activities in the state, The Times of India reports on May 23. Police have put its social media monitoring labs on alert and sensitised its intelligence network particularly in communally sensitive districts in the wake of the IS propaganda. The 22 minute documentary, mostly in Arabic shows jihadists, supposedly from India, who have joined ISIS ranks threatening to return to avenge killing of Muslims in India . Taking note of the video Union Home Minister (UHM) Rajnath Singh had said the Centre was taking all steps to tackle the issue. The cause of concern for the UP Police stems from recent arrest of at least two UP youths who were in touch with the IS through its social media network. While Shakir was arrested by Delhi Police on May 4 from Deoband in Saharanapur for his alleged links with banned terror outfit Jaish e Mohammed (JeM), Rizwan was picked up by the Mumbai Police from Kushinagar District in Uttar Pradesh on January 23. Their arrests have proved that ISIS and its subsidiaries are trying desperately for a foothold on India in general and UP in particular. This is a cause of serious concern, particularly when one finds young blood turning to world s top terror outfits, said a senior IPS officer. The intelligence agencies are verifying if the video and its content are authentic but we have put our intelligence on alert, said Director General of Police (DGP) UP Javeed Ahmed. We have put our social media labs on alert as well and will leave nothing to chance, he said. Youth in our state see through the nefarious designs of such terror outfits and not fall for such false propaganda in the name of religion, he said.	0	0	0	0

Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakshe said there was no intention to incite racism behind his recent statement that several Sri Lankans have gone to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS), Colombo Page reports on November 21. He said he wanted to draw the attention to a dangerous situation that could be risen by hiding the facts and decided to disclose the facts regarding the IS rebels. Justifying his statement the Justice Minister said the even the international media in foreign countries publish the information related to individuals joining the IS in order to suppress the terrorist acts. However, some websites are publishing false news reports and causing damage to the independence of the country s judiciary as well eroding the confidence of the public in the judicial system, the Minister pointed out. The Justice Minister charged that a small number of journalists are using the situation to spread false news reports and create a media mafia. The Minister had informed the Parliament on November 18 that 32 well educated Sri Lankan Muslims of four families have joined the IS in Syria.Earlier, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) had strongly objected to the statement made by the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in Parliament regarding the Muslim community. Issuing a statement on November 19, MCSL president N M Ameen had said Minister s statement implies that 32 Muslims have joined the IS recently. We strongly object to this misplaced statement. The facts given by the Honorable Minister were reported in the media more than one year ago when a Sri Lankan combatant died fighting with ISIS. There have been no new reports of any others involved since this was reported last year, he pointed out. It is believed that one family had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian support to the war wounded and refugees. Some of the men are alleged to have joined or forced to join the fighting forces of ISIS. The Muslim community, including the Muslim Council, Jamiathul Ulema and other organizations cooperated with the government in identifying the families to provide the necessary support for the intelligence agencies to investigate. Those who have gone to Syria as quoted by Hon. Rajapakshe include women and children. he said. Ameen said the Minister s statement comes at a very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image of the Muslim community for reasons only best known to them. The Muslim community is seriously alarmed about the re emergence of the racist campaign that was carried out by extremist Buddhist monks since the end of the war in 2009. Many youth too have started social media campaigns against the Muslim community. The statements made by the Hon Minster would only help to disturb peace and promote the interests of certain vested interests to destroy our country. We urge the Hon Minister and the Government to investigate this and take appropriate action. We urge the government to take immediate steps to halt all form of extremism and restore peace and harmony for all Sri Lankans, the MCSL President said.Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena gave instructions to the law enforcement agencies and security services to arrest those who incite racism and religious extremism in the country and take legal action against them, Colombo Page reports on November 20.

Sri Lanka’s internal war which ended in May 2009 had cost the country around USD 200 billion according to India’s former National Security Adviser (NSA) and Foreign Secretary, Shivshankar Menon, reports Colombo Gazette on December 13. In his book ‘Choices Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy’, Menon says that this estimate does not include the “opportunity cost” to Sri Lanka which was once the fastest growing and the most open economy in South Asia. About deaths, the veteran Indian diplomat turned security expert says that between 1983 and 2009, 80,000 to 100,000 people, including combatants from both sides, lost their lives. Among them were 30,000 to 50,000 civilians, 27,693 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) cadres, 23,790 Sri Lankan Army personnel, and 1,155 men of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF).The final stages of the war had created a little over 300,000 refugees or Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The war had also left 1.6 million land mines in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. But the real casualty of the war was Sri Lanka’s composite society, something that the LTTE and Sinhala chauvinism are “equally responsible for”, Menon says. “Sri Lanka’s democracy was flawed by disappearances, killings, torture, detention, and widespread human rights abuses committed by all sides in the war. Civil military relations were skewed, Sinhala society was militarized, and the brutalized remnants of Tamil civil society were leaderless, without direction or hope. Nor was there any sign of an attempt to come to terms with the legacy and result of the war, to undertake real reconciliation,” he observes grimly. Menon points out that LTTE ‘chief’ Prabhakaran had left his Sri Lankan Tamil community “gutted and brutalized” by his war.	0	0	0	0

The documents says, “Union Government is also supplementing the efforts of the State Governments through various measures such as deployment of Central Security Forces to assist the State Authorities in counter insurgency operations and providing security to vulnerable institutions and installations based on threat assessment”. “Government of India in tandem with the Jammu and Kashmir has adopted a multipronged approach to contain cross border infiltration, promote economic activity, provide relief to victims and strengthen the State Government apparatus”, it added. Concerned over the use of conduits for providing financial support to militant activities in the State, the documents says, “the Government remains committed to disrupt and dismantle the funding of terrorism and all steps will be initiated to choke these channels”.	0	0	0	0

Along with Asadullah Akhtar, Tabrez, Tehseen Akhtar Shaikh, Waqas and Nadeem Akhtar Shaikh, Yasin did an extensive recce of the city, beginning February 2011, said Rakesh Maria, Additional Director General, ATS. “In addition to places where they planted the explosives, they also recceed Colaba Market, because of the number of foreign tourists it attracts, Mumbadevi Temple, Gol Deo Temple, and the offices of the director general of police, commissioner of police and ATS”, Maria added. Tabrez, Waqas and Tehseen are still at large. Police said Bhatkal also confessed to have initially planned to plant an explosive under a stationary Police van at Dadar flower market. On July 13, 2011, however, the van moved away just as Bhatkal and his co conspirator Asadullah Akhtar walked towards it, said ATS officers. The duo then planted the explosive in a garbage bin in the flower market. Maria further said the plotters procured the explosives from Mangalore (Karnataka) a week before the blasts. The ATS had identified the shops from where they purchased nine mm volt batteries, Casio clocks, soldering machines, transistors, and a bow and arrow to complete the circuit. “Around six days before the blasts, they purchased four pressure cookers from two shops in Pydhonie and Ghatkopar. We have identified both of them,” said Maria. After the blasts, Bhatkal, Waqas and Tabrez returned to Habib Mansion in Nagpada, while Tehseen lived elsewhere, he said.

Hospital after he went down with Malaria prior to the blast. Waqas used false identity at the hospital to hide the fact that he was from Pakistan.

Operational and administrative measures implemented by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Police have improved the province s security situation, KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Nasir Khan Durrani said on August 19, reports Central Asia Online. KP has been mostly peaceful for the last few months. Unlike the last few years, Police recorded only a few major terrorist attacks during the first seven months of 2014 and militants failed to commit a major attack during the holy month of Ramadan and during Eid ul Fitr. The measures are paying off as violence is falling, according to reports kept by the Police. Terrorist attacks between July 2012 and June 2013 totalled 456, Peshawar Superintendent of Police (SP) Sohaib Ashraf said. That number fell to 401 the following year. Police reported 25 suicide bombings in KP in July 2012 June 2013. That number fell to eight in the next cycle. The number of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bombings also decreased from 321 to 237. Casualties dropped from 380 to 310. However, two categories saw higher numbers rocket attacks (22, up from 4) and targeted killings (129, up from 99). The increase in rocket attacks is a manifestation of desperation among the militants who have been denied space and entry into the settled areas by the police force, Ashraf said. Peshawar saw frequent attacks from Khyber Agency and adjacent Dara Adamkhel until the start of 2014. But since then, the situation has improved greatly.	0	0	0	0

Additional Director General (ADG) anti Maoist operation and Inspector General, Durg range, of Chhattisgarh held wide ranging discussions for two days with their Odisha counterparts and other key officials on the matter in Bhubaneswar a few days ago, said sources.

Gujarat Police officials said agencies such as the State Anti Terrorists Squad (ATS), Special Operations Group (SOG) and district and city Police agencies have lodged 85 offences in December 2015 and the first six months of 2016, where Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) worth INR 5.3 crore were seized, The Times of India reports on July 23. In last three months alone, Ahmedabad Police registered five cases involving FICN, where each case worth over INR 10,000 in face value. As the security agencies see FICN cases as closely associated with instances of terrorism and anti social activities, the recent figures show that Gujarat ranks among top five states, reporting the biggest seizures of FICN.A senior official said that compared to INR 1 crore in 2012, the amount has increased five times in 2016. Moreover, earlier consignments were smaller while 133 persons were caught for the INR 1 crore haul, now 167 were caught for INR 5.3 crore. Investigation of these cases reveal that most of these notes come from West Bengal with illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. The town of Malda is particularly identified as a smuggling point. While traditional routes also involve Nepal and by sea, the porous India Bangladesh border is exploited where many immigrants buy notes for cheap or bring them for sale in India, said an investigator.	0	0	0	0
The joint intelligence committee of the Centre has accused Bihar Government of being soft on the CPI Maoist resulting in a 41 increase in killings by Maoists this year compared to the previous year, reports The Times of India. The intelligence agencies have informed the Centre and the Prime Minister that Bihar Government has not taken effective steps to control Red terror. A report submitted by the committee says, There has been continual deterioration in most parameters of the counterinsurgency grid in Bihar. Bihar government is soft towards the Maoists. The report has mentioned that 38 persons, including 25 civilians and 13 securitymen, were killed this year, compared to 25 last year. It says while there has been a substantial decline in Maoist violence in the country, Bihar has registered an increase. Our concern is not only a sharp increase in security forces casualties but also the fact that not a single Maoist cadre has been killed in counterinsurgency operations this year, compared to five during the same period last year, the report says. The performance of anti Maoist grid in the state has been decidedly weak. While 17 encounters with Maoists took place in 2011, the number of cross firings between security forces and Maoists decreased to 12 in 2012 and till August this year, only six encounters took place in Bihar. Moreover, recovery of weapons has also shown a downward trend from 171 in 2011 to 47 in 2013. Though 32 out of 38 Districts of Bihar are Maoist affected, the Maoist violence this year was confined to only 16 Districts. The most affected areas are Gaya, Aurangabad and Jamui Districts.	0	0	0	0

The Telegraph reports on May 14 that security agencies trying to cleanse the Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD) of illegal arms say the flow of arms and involvement of militants make the job tough. The challenge before us is that many of those supplying arms in the BTAD are either members of a militant group or former militants who are well trained in transporting weapons by concealing them to avoid our glare. They use these techniques even after they surrender and get into arms supplies. This makes our job tough, a senior Police officer said. The officer said nearly 300 illegal arms and over 200 grenades had been seized from the BTAD since 2012 but the problem was far from over since the flow of weapons through Nagaland and Mizoram was still on. Most of these arms, like the AK series rifles and M20 rifles, come from South East Asian countries such as Myanmar and China. Of late, we have found small arms coming in from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as well. We are in constant touch with Nagaland and Mizoram Police to check the supply of arms, he added.	0	0	0	0

Investigations into the Indian module of Islamic State (IS) inspired Junood al Khalifa e Hind, is leading a trail to Dubai, dnaindia.com reports on April 29. Bhatkal resident Ismail Abdul Rauf’s interrogation has given leads to investigators on missing links that could be a part of the large puzzle, including the alleged Islamic State (IS) fighter Shafi Armar alias Yousuf al Hindi, and how he purportedly funded to raise an Indian affiliated jihadi group through Dubai.Known as the centre of money laundering or hawala operations, Dubai, along with other countries in the Gulf region, houses a large Indian diaspora. Importantly, various armed groups, including the IS, in the ongoing conflict in Syria are funded through a network of private donations, collected from sheikhs, tribal leaders, influential ulemas and Arab diaspora based in Gulf countries. These two factors could be a starting point in unraveling the funding of Junood al Khalifa e Hind group outside the Indian territory by the Indians living in Gulf.Rauf had earlier travelled to Dubai 10 months ago to work as a labourer and came into contact with another Bhatkal resident, Ismail Nanda. During the time of their acquaintance, Nanda asked Rauf if he knew any hawala operators in Dubai and the latter gave contact of an operator, Abdullah Umaid. Officials investigating the case said Rauf was later contacted by Nanda and asked to check if Nadeem (code name for Sheikh’s hawala transaction) got the money. Rauf did not know who Mudabbir Sheikh was but it is believed that Nanda used the hawala operator in Dubai, suggested by Rauf, to make the transaction. Rauf was earlier a suspect in the case, but National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now made him a witness and is verifying the information provided by him. The agency is also making use of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) with Dubai to dig deep into Nanda s identity and find if he facilitated the hawala transactions to India at the behest of al Hindi or any other IS leader. If substantiated, it will take the investigation closer to proving that al Hindi used the IS group’s funds collected illegally by smuggling and selling oil, antiquities, collecting taxes from population living in its territory, ransom and selling Yezidi women as slaves among other methods to raise a module in India.	0	0	0	0

A report submitted to the Government has said that banned terror outfit Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) was behind the attack in Jammu and Kashmir (J K) on September 26, in which 13 persons were killed, reported NDTV on September 27. Al Shahada (the Martyrs) group has claimed the responsibility for the attack, but security agencies say they aren t taking the claim seriously. We aren t attaching little credence to the claim, said an unnamed senior official. Security agencies are basing their claim on the information given by Roshan Lal Sharma, a driver who was forced to commandeer the tempo truck used by the terrorists to enter Hiranagar Police Station in Kathua District. The driver has reportedly told the investigators that the terrorists were speaking in Urdu laced Punjabi. We know for a fact that majority LeT cadres are from Punjab region, said an official. The officials say that the modus operandi of the attack also points to the involvement of the LeT, which carried out two similar attacks in 2008. Moreover, security agencies have also reasoned that the Lashkar has, in the past tried, to disrupt National Highway 1, which connects the Kashmir valley to Jammu and is therefore one of the most crucial road links. It fits into a pattern that we have seen earlier. Also, weapons recovered from the killed militants three AK 47 rifles, one pistol, eight grenades and 12 magazines have the traditional trade mark of the LeT, a senior official said. The LeT is known to carry out spectacular attacks with meticulous training, planning and minimal weapons.	0	0	0	0

Three British nationals, including the ringleader of a terror cell trained in Pakistan have been jailed for masterminding a plot to set off up to eight bombs in the United Kingdom (UK) that could have been more devastating than the 9 11 in the US and the July 7 attacks, Zee News reported on April 26. The three men had raised an estimated 39,000 pounds for terror training and to fund the UK attacks. The money was raised through street collections in Birmingham, under the false pretence of raising money for Muslim charities. Irfan Naseer (31) will have to serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars, while his accomplice Irfan Khalid (28) was jailed for 18 years and Ashik Ali was sentenced to 15 years. Irfan Naseer was the leader, driving force and man in charge and he alone must take responsibility for sending four young men to Pakistan for terrorism training, Justice Henriques told London s Woolwich Crown Court on April 25. The sentencing coincides with the announcement of new UK Government rules under which suspected terrorists face having their passports confiscated. UK Home Secretary Theresa May said the move would prevent Britons travelling abroad to fight or attend terrorist training camps, like the Birmingham based trio who had been found guilty in February of masterminding a plot that could have been more devastating than the July 7 attacks on Londons transport network back in 2005.	0	0	0	0

Pakistan on October 25 renewed demands for an end to United States (US) drone strikes on its territory as two UN experts called for greater transparency in the use of the weapons, reports The Express Tribune. “In Pakistan, all drone strikes are a chilling reminder that reprisal strikes by terrorists are around the corner,” Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Masood Khan said during a UN General Assembly rights committee debate. Khan, following up a call made by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to US President Barack Obama on October 23, 2013, said civilians had suffered “inhumane” deaths and the strikes had “radicalised” public opinion in Pakistan. “We call for the immediate cessation of drone attacks inside the territorial borders of Pakistan,” Khan said, adding, “We hope that the United States would respond to this urgent call from Pakistan anchored in international humanitarian law”. In addition, two U.N. human rights investigators said that U.S. secrecy about its drone strikes is the biggest obstacle to determining the impact on civilians, reported The News. Ben Emmerson and Christof Heyns are also calling on other countries to speak up about when they believe deadly drone strikes are acceptable. They say a lack of consensus risks creating anarchy as more countries acquire the technology. Emmerson said the U.S. has justified drone strikes against terrorist targets in other countries by arguing that it is engaged in an armed conflict against al Qaeda with no boundaries. He said few other countries have spelled out their own positions. He added, “The moment other states start to use this technology in similar ways, we will face a situation which could escalate into a breakdown of peace and security.	0	0	0	0

No US assistance can be provided to Pakistan unless the Obama administration certifies to Congress that Pakistan did not have any information about Osama bin Ladens whereabouts, says a bill introduced in the House of Representatives, Dawn reported on May 6. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs but a growing number of both Republican and Democratic lawmakers are urging their colleagues not to take decisions that may hurt US interests. Congress has already appropriated USD three billion in aid to Pakistan for this year, said Congressman Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, while introducing the bill. Unless Pakistan can prove that they were not providing sanctuary for Americas number one enemy, they should not receive any American aid. Co sponsors Congressmen Vern Buchanan, John Culberson and Allen West, all Republicans also want to punish Pakistan but many see it as a hasty move. It is not the time to back away from Pakistan but rather a time to strengthen ties, said House Speaker John Boehner.

Cooperating with Pakistan in the fight against terrorism is essential to maintain pressure on al Qaeda after Osama bin Ladens death, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief Leon Panetta said on June 9, reported Daily Times. Continuing cooperation with Pakistan is critical to keep a tremendous amount of pressure on al Qaedas leadership and the networks that provide it support and safe havens at a time when it is most vulnerable, Panetta said, warning Pakistan to do more to step up in the fight against terrorism. Al Qaeda linked militants who control much of Somalia are looking to extend their operations and carry out attacks abroad, Panetta said, adding, The threat from al Shebab to the United States (US) and Western interests in the Horn of Africa and to the US homeland is significant and on the rise. Further, Panetta added that the US has an extremely frustrating and complicated relationship with Pakistan and it cant succeed in Afghanistan without succeeding in Pakistan. I strongly urge those in Pakistan to take steps to do whatever they can to prevent cross border attacks and to prevent the safe havens that do exist on the Pakistani side of the border, Panetta said. This is a difficult challenge, he added. The relationship with Pakistan is at the same time one of the most critical and yet one of the most complicated and frustrating relationships that we have, added Panetta.	0	0	0	0

You remember when thousands of Pakistani youth fought your proxy war in Afghanistan and in Indian Kashmir....

In the trial of former President General (retired) Pervez Musharraf, the prosecution on January 27 rejected Armed Forces Institute of Cardiologys (AFIC) medical report as hypothetical, inconclusive and unsatisfactory, reported The Express Tribune. The report contains conjectures and hypothetical situations, which are inapplicable to the accused and as such do not deserve a serious consideration, said the prosecution in its written objection. It said the Special Court had directed the constitution of a medical board comprising senior doctors of the AFIC to verify Musharrafs state of health in light of his continuous non appearance before this Special court. The instant medical report, with respect to any outcomes, is virtually a duplication of the previous medical report dated January 7, 2014.
