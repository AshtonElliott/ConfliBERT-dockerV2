Mullah Baradar, the former Afghan Taliban second in command recently released by Pakistan, has been shifted to a safe house in Peshawar near the Afghan border, a step closer to starting peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, security sources said on October 3, reports The Express Tribune. Afghanistan and the United States believe Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar holds the key to stopping the war in Afghanistan because he is influential enough to persuade his former comrades to stop fighting. But his movements have been shrouded in secrecy since Pakistan announced his release on September 20. Baradar remains effectively under house arrest in Pakistan. Baradar was moved from one safe house in Karachi to another, and has now been moved to Peshawar, one senior defence official told Reuters. He has been in regular touch with his colleagues and the dialogue is on course. However, Afghan Taliban leaders said that they would not meet their former commander Mullah Baradar in Peshawar as they believe he is still not a free man and is escorted by intelligence officials. Despite announcements of Baradar being released, he is still believed to be in custody and watched closely by intelligence agents, an arrangement which is likely to undermine his role as a peacemaker. Following his release, he spent some time in Karachi and now arrived in Peshawar to hold meetings, a source told Reuters.	0	0	0	0

The smuggling of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) has fallen sharply along India’s border with Bangladesh since the government’s demonetisation move, livemint.com reports on December 5.On the India Bangladesh border, while the smuggling of FICN has been on the rise over the past eight years, it saw a reduction from INR 2.87 crore in 2015 to INR 1.53 crore in 2016, as of the third week of November, according to data provided by the Border Security Force (BSF).Data provided by security forces and the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) show that the smuggling of fake currency was down from INR 43.83 crore in 2015 to INR 27.70 crore in September 2016.“The printing press of fake currency notes has taken a big hit. The quantum of old Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes that had earlier been printed has gone to waste. They still have not been able to print the new notes,” a senior BSF official said stated.However, on the India Pakistan border, security forces said the situation was much more grim.The smuggling of FICN had come down over time, but had made way for an almost impenetrable narcotics network, which, according to BSF officials, had its biggest clientele in Punjab.This, the officials explained, was because of two reasons India’s border with Pakistan is much more tightly guarded, because of the current security situation, than the border in the east because Bangladesh is a friendly nation. So, when smugglers operate their network in the west, it is primarily for higher risk goods such as heroin and other narcotics, than for FICN. Second, the economy in western India is more affluent, which means more people are able to afford illegal narcotics.	0	0	0	0

Furqan, an ex filtrated militant of LeT was in contact with Muza Molvi and both of them made the ultimate plan of the twin blasts. Mir said that the leads about the involvement of module in militant activities came to fore after the arrest of Muzaffar Ahmad Mir, the militant responsible for the killing of Sajad Ahmad Parray, a Police Constable at Hazratbal on October 14.

Progressive faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland(NDFB P)appealed to tribal Members of Parliament (MPs) to support and raise the issue of a separate Bodoland in Parliament, reports The Telegraph. In a statement, S. Sanjarang, the outfit s information and publicity secretary, on July 31, said the outfit has had 14 rounds of dialogue with the Centre on sovereignty. Owing to lack of political will on the part of the Centre, the dialogue has not been productive, he said, adding that the All Bodo Student s Union (ABSU) has resumed its movement together with the NDFB P. Till now, five rounds of talks have been held with ABSU and its allied organisations but with no progress. The last one was held on the June 9, 2015, Sanjarang said.He said the Bodo people have a distinct history because they were an independent nation and have a distinct identity with unique language and culture. Not only that, their population is the biggest among the indigenous people of the region, he said. Despite all these, the Bodo people have been repeatedly denied and deprived of their legitimate right to a state. This is a gross historical injustice. Instead of granting statehood, the Centre attempted to console the Bodos by granting Bodoland Autonomous Council and later Bodoland Territorial Areas District (in 1993 and 2003), which practically are paralysed and impotent administrative set ups, incapable of addressing the very fundamental questions of the Bodos and other indigenous people, Sanjarang said. The NDFB P appealed to the MPs belonging to the indigenous community to raise the issue in Parliament so that the long standing problem can be resolved to usher in permanent peace in the region	0	0	0	0

Citing security reason, the Director General (DG) of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Lieutenant General Zaheer ul Islam did not appear before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on April 2 in a missing person case, reports Dawn. The IHC, however, disposed off the matter after the spy agency denied the custody of the missing man.

Before being picked up, Mohammad Arif, a former activist of Jamaat e Islami (JeI), was running a printing press and private schools in Rawalpindi District. However, DG ISI, in an affidavit submitted to the IHC, denied the custody of the missing men. Additional Attorney General (AAG) Tariq Mehmood Khokar submitted an application on behalf of the ISI seeking exemption of the DG from appearance. In the application the spy agency contended For operational security and secrecy reasons his (DG ISI) whereabouts are kept classified.

It further said that the DG of the spy agency was not the relevant officer in the matter in question. Justice Khan expressed annoyance over the lethargy of the spy agency in dealing with the court.

It was an insult for the judiciary he added. However, Colonel Fayyaz, Deputy Director Legal of the ISI tendered an apology before the court.	0	0	0	0

Expressing concern at the unabated illegal migration, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on September 7 underlined the need for formal agreements and creation of joint mechanisms between India and its neighbours to ensure elimination of illegal crossovers, drug trafficking and infiltration, reports The Assam Tribune. “Unless India’s neighbours are made to realise that it was in the interest of both countries to stop infiltration and incursions, the security of countries will remain at stake,” he said while delivering the keynote address at FICCI India Foundation convention on ‘Homeland Security 2016 Smart Borders Management’ in New Delhi.

Meanwhile, Nagaland Chief Minister TR Zeliang on August 29 clarified that neither he nor the State Government were in possession of the ‘Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015’ and that they trust the statements of the negotiators that “the best interest of the Naga people would be ensured while evolving a negotiated settlement”, reports The Assam Tribune. Responding to the allegations levelled against Zeliang by leaders of four Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs), the CM’s Office (CMO) in a statement termed them as “some serious but unwarranted allegations”. It said Zeliang had stated on many occasions that if anyone had doubts or wanted to know details of the Framework Agreement, they could do so with interlocutor RN Ravi instead of “speculating and interpreting as per one’s own understanding.” Taking a jab at some people who said there was nothing for the people of Nagaland in the Framework Agreement, the CMO said it appeared that such people had seen the contents. It said there were also some people who asked how they could support the agreement without seeing the contents. The CMO said the Chief Minister was of the considered opinion that “we should not confuse our people with such ambiguous statements”.	0	0	0	0

The United States (US) on June 5 said that al Qaeda number two Abu Yahya al Libi was killed in a drone attack at Hisokhel, east of Miranshah, the headquarter of North Waziristan Agency of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on June 4, reports Dawn. “Our government has been able to confirm al Libi’s death,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney, ending a prolonged US tussle with a man who once escaped from a US jail in Afghanistan, and had defied previous attempts to kill him. “It is significant,” another US official said, saying Libi headed al Qaeda operations in Pakistan and had outreached to affiliates such as Yemen based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has attacked US targets. News of the killing of Libi followed reports detailing the scope of the US campaign against global terrorism, including revelations that President Barack Obama personally presides over a “kill list” of top suspects. Al Libi, a hero in militant circles for his 2005 escape from the US military prison in Bagram, Afghanistan, was elevated to al Qaeda’s No. 2 spot when Ayman al Zawahri rose to replace the slain Osama bin Laden. Militants and residents in the area told Pakistani agents that al Libi was in the house when it was hit, Pakistani intelligence officials said. They said the mud and brick house was completely destroyed. A local Taliban chief, on condition of anonymity, said al Libi was not present at the house, though his guard and driver were killed. However, residents of the village said Libi was killed as an unusually high number of militants gathered there after the drone strike and they kept people away. They usually bury the bodies after a drone strike in the nearest graveyard, said one of the villagers, describing the aftermath of previous strikes in the area. This time they put all the bodies in their cars and took them away.	0	0	0	0

Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde of the Supreme Court has suggested setting up of a common court for SAARC member countries to deal with cross border terror attacks and crimes like smuggling of Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN), drugs and weapons, India Today reports on March 12. To bring to justice perpetrators of trans border terror attacks and crimes, a sitting judge of the Supreme Court has proposed the setting up of a common court for South Asia. Could we consider having a common court for these countries that comprises of judges from all these countries that share the matter, Bobde said addressing the United Nations Counter Terrorism Committee in New York. In his address on need for common courts for cross border terror cases, Bobde referred to the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attack case. 166 people lost their lives when 10 Pakistani terrorists attacked Mumbai. He spoke of how terrorists, trained, armed and launched from Pakistan, had attacked Mumbai and were guided by their handlers in Pakistan throughout the three daylong terror strike. This was their advantage (plot hatched in Pakistan and handlers across the border) and the disadvantage India had was that they did not know what the plan was and where the attackers would go next, Bobde added. A court consisting of judges of all SAARC countries in the region will perhaps ensure swifter justice as it will ensure collaboration on trans border cases, sources said. Justice Bobde also suggested a secure website that can provide judges of the member countries access to information available to other judges (in the SAARC region) on modus operandi of terror group, arms and equipment used by terrorists and their handlers, sources added. Justice Bobde also suggested Apex Court judges visiting each other s law academies to understand law and its application in member countries.	0	0	0	0

Al Qaedas new second in command, Atiyah abd al Rahman, was killed earlier this week in Pakistan, US officials said on August 27. Rahman, a Libyan national, rose to the number two spot when Ayman al Zawahri took the reins of al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed. Officials did not say how Rahman was killed, but said it happened in Waziristan where intelligence officials believe members of al Qaeda are hiding out. Atiyahs death is a tremendous loss for al Qaeda, because (Zawahri) was relying heavily on him to help guide and run the organization, especially since bin Ladens death, one US official said. The trove of materials from bin Ladens compound showed clearly that Atiyah was deeply involved in directing al Qaedas operations even before the raid. He had multiple responsibilities in the organization and will be very difficult to replace, the official said. Rahman ran daily operations for the group, spoke on behalf of bin Laden and Zawahri and was the one that affiliates knew and trusted and his death will make it more difficult for Zawahri to consolidate control, the official said. He planned the details of al Qaeda operations and its propaganda. His combination of background, experience, and abilities are unique in al Qaeda without question, they will not be easily replaced, the official said.	0	0	0	0

A statement issued by CorCom media coordinator Ksh Yoiheiba conveyed warm greetings to all workers and peasants of the world.

The CorCom highlighted the growing need to groom a vibrant work culture and replace all migrant workers engaged in both public sectors and private sectors by the people of the land.

The London based Bureau of Investigative Journalism on August 1 said that its field investigation in Pakistans tribal areas appears to confirm that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 2012 briefly revived the controversial tactic of deliberately targeting rescuers at the scene of a previous drone strike, reports The News. It said the tactic has previously been labelled a possible war crime by two United Nations (UN) investigators. A statement said the Bureaus research confirmed that five double tap strikes took place in mid 2012, one of which also struck a mosque. In total 53 people were killed, and 57 injured. The new study focused mainly on strikes around a single village in North Waziristan attacks that were aimed at one of al Qaedas few remaining senior figures, Abu Yahya al Libi. He was finally killed by a CIA drone strike on June 4 2012. Congressional aides have previously been reported as describing to the Los Angeles Times reviewing a CIA video showing Abu Yahya al Libi alone being killed. But the Bureaus field research appears to confirm what others reported at the time that al Libis death was part of a sequence of strikes on the same location that killed up to 16 people. If correct, that would indicate that Congressional aides were not shown crucial additional video material. The CIA has rejected the charge. Spokesman Edward Price told the Bureau, The CIA takes its commitment to Congressional oversight with the utmost seriousness. The Agency provides accurate and timely information consistent with our obligation to the oversight Committees. Any accusation alleging otherwise is baseless. The Bureau first broke the story of the CIAs deliberate targeting of rescuers in a February 2012 investigation for The Sunday Times.	0	0	0	0

A downward trend in the number of overall incidents of violence, which had started in 2010 and continued in the two subsequent years, could not persist in 2013 reported The News on January 5. It took a slight upward curve during the campaign for the 2013 general election and sustained until the year’s end. This was revealed in the Pakistan Security Report 2013, produced and recently released by an Islamabad based research institute Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). According to the PIPS report, militant, nationalist insurgent and violent sectarian groups carried out a total of 1,717 terrorist attacks across Pakistan in 2013, claiming the lives of 2,451 people and causing injuries to another 5,438. As compared to 2012, the number of reported terrorist attacks in Pakistan in 2013 posted a nine per cent increase while the number of people killed and injured in these attacks increased by 19 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively. The major actor of instability in the country in 2013 was the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Despite the killing of some of its top leaders in Drone attacks and also military operations launched by Pakistani Security Forces (SFs), the operational capabilities of the group remained intact. An alliance of numerous militant groups and commanders, TTP proved lethal in 2013 as it carried out 645 terrorist attacks in 50 Districts across the country, claiming the lives of 732 civilians and 425 SFs personnel. A rise in sectarian violence that started in 2011 continued through 2012 towards the end of 2013. While the overall incidents of sectarian violence, including sectarian related attacks and clashes, posted a slight increase in 2013 as compared to 2012, the number of people killed and injured in these incidents significantly increased. The number of suicide attacks across the country rose by 39 per cent, with 46 suicide attacks in 2013 compared to 33 in 2012. As many as 18 (39 per cent) out of the total suicide attacks in 2013 were recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 12 in Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA), 9 in Balochistan, 5 in Sindh and 1 each in Rawalpindi and Azad Kashmir. Of the total, 34 suicide attacks were perpetrated by the TTP and other similar militant groups, 9 were sectarian related mainly carried out by Lashkar e Jhangvi (LeJ) and 1 suicide blast was carried out by nationalist insurgents. Another 2 attacks were carried out in inter militant clashes. US Drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas registered a 31 per cent decrease in 2013 compared to the previous year and fatalities in these attacks also fell by 39 per cent. Out of 31 reported Drone attacks in 2013, as many as 24 struck militants and their hideouts in North Waziristan Agency, in FATA. Five Drone strikes were reported in South Waziristan, and one each in Khyber Agency and Hangu, a settled District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The number of overall cross border attacks and clashes increased in 2013, particularly along Pak India border (including the Line of Control and the working boundary), but the casualties in these attacks decreased. Most of the cross border attacks and clashes (68, or 66 per cent) were reported from Pakistan’s border with India 26 and 9 attacks, respectively, were reported from Pakistan’s borders with Afghanistan and Iran. On the whole, 103 border attacks and clashes were reported from Pakistan’s borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran, which were 30 percent more than such incidents in 2012. As many as 59 Pakistani citizens, including personnel of security forces and civilians lost their lives in these incidents, 82 per cent less than the killings in such incidents in 2012. The incidents of ethno political violence in Pakistan increased by 22 per cent, from 183 in 2012 to 224 in 2013, but the fatalities in these incidents slightly decreased from 288 in 2012 to 283 in 2013. While most incidents of ethno political violence in 2013 were concentrated in Karachi (over 81 per cent), such incidents were reported from a total of 28 districts in all four provinces of Pakistan. It was apparently due to the May 2013 elections that the ethno political violence in the country became more complex with increasing number of political parties becoming either part of it or being targeted in politically motivated targeted killings. Despite a decrease in fatalities in 2013 in the overall incidents of violence, the number of civilians killed in these incidents increased by 16 per cent and of civilians injured by 34 per cent. However, the number of militants killed in 2013 in overall incidents of violence declined by 28 percent. Fatalities among SFs personnel also modestly decreased, by almost two per cent.	0	0	0	0

Former President General (retired) Pervez Musharraf in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on February 25 said that Kabul must share power with the extremist group Taliban and block Indian influence if it wants peace in the country, reports Dawn. He said that Afghan President Ashraf Ghanis September inauguration presented a new opportunity for reconciliation between the Government and Taliban and related insurgent groups. Ashraf Ghani is a balanced man, he said, adding, I think hes a great hope. Pakistan and India must stay away and avoid engaging in proxy war, he said. He further said that India had provided weapons, training and equipment to ethnic Baloch separatists inside Afghanistan. He said that United States (US) and its allies had consistently failed to consider Pakistans concerns, forcing Islamabad to rely on other militant groups inside Afghanistan to prop up its interests. He acknowledged that India and Pakistan had been engaged in a long running proxy war on Afghan soil that fed the conflict. But, he said, his and Islamabads role in nurturing the Taliban and allied militant groups operating in Afghanistan were a legitimate counterweight against its rival India there. There are enemies of Pakistan that have to be countered, he said, adding, Certainly if theres an enemy of mine, I will use somebody to counter him. The world must realise that we may not like the face of Mullah Omarbut that is how life is, that is what Afghanistan is, said Musharraf. But he said those groups were an instrument to counter Indias influence on the ground in Afghanistan and insisted that former US President George W. Bush knew that I am not playing a double game with Washington.	0	0	0	0

Director General of Police (DGP) Kuldeep Khoda said that Police was working on all leads, including a possible nexus between the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) and Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), who might have jointly plotted the terror strike which was foiled with the recovery of the car laden with explosives in Ambala in Haryana on October 12. Asserting that Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) was not an active outfit in Jammu, Khoda said Police had reports that KZF was trying to revive itself. The KZF is headed by Ranjeet Singh alias Neeta of Simbal in Jammu, who was presently operating from Lahore in Pakistan. Recently, there had been reports of a nexus developing between Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir militants, which were corroborated with the reports that Neeta was trying to revive KZF in Jammu. The explosives were reportedly packed and sent from Jammu and Kashmir. The spot could be anywhere in Jammu and Kashmir but since the role of KZF is emerging, the possibility of supply of explosives somewhere in Jammu including the border areas is not ruled out, sources said, adding the KZF might have helped the BKI in the terror plot hatched jointly with the LeT outfit. We had inputs that an LeT module active in Jammu and Kashmir was planning to strike in Delhi. Investigations were done and found that the explosives were meant for BKI and to be used in Delhi. We received a specific input yesterday October 11 about the movement, Arun Kampani, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) said. The DGP further said there were no doubts over Police claims that Doda and Reasi Districts were free of militancy but admitted that the militants kept on moving from one place to another. Some groups of militants are active. There is no doubt about that. However, Police too have killed many militants and solved various blast mysteries We would also work on way and means to ensure that terror plots originating from Kishtwar and other parts of J K to New Delhi are not repeated, he added. Investigations so far reveal that the blast outside Delhi High Court on September 7 was carried out by the militants of Kishtwar District of Jammu region with the help of some modules.	0	0	0	0

The Shillong Times reports on November 20 that as many as seven Achik National Volunteer Council (ANVC) cadres have reportedly fled from their liaison office at Tura youth hostel with a substantial number of weapons to form a new outfit called the Achik Tigers Force (ATF) blaming the Government and the outfits leaders for turning a blind eye to their problems. The cadres reportedly fled under the leadership of Balsrang who happens to be the camp in charge. Speaking to The Shillong Times, Balsrang said that seven of them abandoned the outfit on November 15 and decamped with five automatic assault rifles, seven pistols, ten hand grenades and four hundred rounds of ammunition from the armory of the ANVC. We have been unhappy with the state of affairs in our organization. The government has not given us our stipend for the last eight months and have abandoned us, said Balsrang, who has now taken the name of Dilchong Ioimingchi to lead the ATF. He also attacked the ANVC leaders for treating its cadres with disdain and blamed the leadership for the present crisis within the outfit. We are no longer able to withstand the suffering and felt the only way was to return to the jungle and once again lead an armed struggle, said the new militant chief. There is apprehension that more cadres of the group could follow in their footsteps as the new militant chief has revealed that it is wooing other disgruntled members of the ANVC to join their fold. This will be the third major split within the ANVC since its formation in the mid 1990s. The first split took place in 2009 with its former militant commander Sohan D Shira leaving the group to form his own Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA).

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has approached the National Central Bureau (NCB), a wing under Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that acts as Interpol in India, for issuing red corner notice (RCN) against 19 Keralites, including five women, who are believed to have joined Islamic State (IS) in Afghanistan, New Indian Express reports on December 14.

We suspect the accused have reached Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan, where IS has gained a foothold after Syria, Iraq and North African countries. Hence tracking them would not be easy,” the official said. In all, 22 persons 14 men, five women and three children were reported absconding from Kasargod and Palakkad. The children were not named as accused in the case.Earlier, the Interpol issued RCNs against 23 Keralites 20 men and 3 women.

Quoting The New York Times on February 7 Dawn reported that a senior American Military Commander, General James N. Mattis, the head of the Central Military Command, is expected to travel to Pakistan in February 2012 in what Obama administration officials say is the first step towards thawing a strategic relationship that has in effect remained frozen for more than two months. General Mattis will meet Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to discuss the investigation of November 26, 2011 exchange of fire at the Afghan border that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, as well as new border coordination procedures to prevent a recurrence of the incident, The New York Times said. The State Department is supporting a proposal circulating in the administration for the United States (US) to issue a formal apology for the deaths of the Pakistani soldiers in the air strike by American gunships. Weve felt an apology would be helpful in creating some space, said an American official who has been briefed on the State Departments view and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Soon after the lethal air strike, the White House decided that President Obama would not offer formal condolences to Pakistan, overruling State Department officials who argued for such a show of remorse to help salvage relations. Some administration aides said at the time that they were worried that if Obama decided to overrule the military and apologize to Pakistan, it could become ammunition for his Republican opponents in the presidential campaign.	0	0	0	0

The year 2013 is emerging as the deadliest one in decades for the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in Karachi as in the first six months of 2013 more than 100 Policemen and Rangers personnel have been killed in different parts of the city amid growing violence and worsening law and order, said an official on July 7, reports Dawn. “A total of 93 Policemen have been killed this year in the first six months January to June 2013 ,” said an official citing a number of casualties of Karachi Police. “The victims ranked from constable to a Deputy Superintendent of Police and almost all of them have been targeted for their professional association. Hardly there would be a Policeman or two, who had some personal issues that cost him his life as otherwise most of the Policemen were killed while performing their duties in all five Districts of the city — south, east, west, central and Malir,” added the official. The official said that in the first six months of 2012, a total of 44 Policemen were killed in Karachi. This year posed a more serious threat to personnel of the key LEA as compared to the previous years. The official said that since 2000, over 420 Police officials had been shot dead in several parts of the city.

The terrorists who raided Pathankot air base may have entered India assisted by a drugs racket along both sides of the Indo Pakistan border and the heavy arms and ammunition used by them could have been dispatched from the neighbouring country before they crossed the border, New Indian Express reports on January 4. Security agencies suspect that the terrorists crossed the International Border in Punjab through a controlled operation by a gang involved in the smuggling of narcotics, Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and arms.The possibility of the involvement of some security personnel with the smuggling gang cannot be ruled out as there have been inputs in the past about some elements being linked to the establishment of the drugs racket, the sources said. A detailed probe and questioning of some people involved in the racket could unearth the conspiracy, they added.Speculation is rife that the heavy arms and ammunition used by the terrorists in the attack were sent over from Pakistan much before the terrorists crossed the International Border. There is a high probability that the arms were sent through the drugs racket and dumped at a designated spot from where the terrorists collected these after crossing the border through a route used by the smugglers, sources said.	0	0	0	0

National Investigation Agency (NIA) that is probing Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICNs) racket operating in India, found that approximately INR 15 billion of counterfeit notes pumped into the country have crossed the border through Malda border in West Bengal, The Times of India reports on June 30. The investigators have also found that most of the notes that have entered the country have been printed in Pakistan and was routed to India through Bangladesh. The National Investigating Agency say that 90 per cent of fake currency that is brought into the country have a link with the Malda unit which smuggles these notes. The investigators have found that there was dedicated lot of Pakistanis who set up shops in Bangladesh and these shops are breeding ground for trading these FICNs which are eventually routed to into India. Malda is an easy landing point as it borders with Bangladesh. This is a racket that has been going on for the past four to five years now ever since the border with Pakistan became extremely difficult for these criminals to operate on. After the money comes to the hands of these module operatives, they pick up several youths to execute the job. They go to major cities like Mumbai or Bengaluru and start working as construction labour. Along with their work they start circulating the notes in installments. They stay on in these cities for a couple of months and manage to circulate at least INR 2,00,000 worth of fake currency each, an investigating officer said. The investigators have also found that the quality of the notes was of extremely superior and most of the security measures were preset in the notes naturally making it very difficult for the common people to understand that it is a fake currency. Sometimes it is even difficult for the bank personnel to realise the difference without a forensic test. This is really alarming, an officer said. The investigators also noticed that the notes sourced by Pakistan to print its own currency was being used to print the Indian fake currency as well.	0	0	0	0

Preliminary forensic reports suggest that the bomb used in the Bangalore (Karnataka) blast of April 17, 2013 is similar to the ones used near Jama Masjid in New Delhi on September 19, 2010, Zaveri Bazar, Mumbai (Maharashtra) on July 13, 2011 and also in the twin blasts in Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh) on February 21, 2013, The Times of India reports on April 20.Initial findings indicated that a metal container was used to assemble an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) for the Bangalore blast. It carried 800 to 900 grams of nitrate based explosive material. It was more like an incendiary device to cause fire similar to the one that was used for a mild blast in a Maruti car outside Jama Masjid in 2010. Though there was no shrapnel in it, the device appeared similar to what Indian Mujahideen (IM) had used in carrying out blasts at Zaveri Bazar in Mumbai. Incidentally, a motorbike was used to strap the bomb in the Zaveri Bazar incident also. Although the explosives used to make IED for Bangalore blast look more like ammonium nitrate, we are waiting for the final report, said an official, adding the make of the bomb had a clear IM signature where the terror outfit generally uses locally available material to assemble nitrate based bombs with the help of any metal container or pressure cooker to make the device more compact.	0	0	0	0

Now Pakistan is fuelling unrest in the Valley,” she said, adding India has extended hand of friendship to Pakistan sincerely but it was not reciprocated by the neighbouring country.Taking on the separatists and other “influential people” fuelling unrest in Kashmir, Mehbooba charged them with “driving innocent children and youth” to the path of violence by making them stone pelters and forcing them to target Security Forces (SFs) and camps and Police Stations but, at the same time, sending their own kin to different parts of India for studies. “What we will do with the Medical and Engineering Colleges, if they don’t produce doctors and engineers if the vested interests continue to drive children and youth to the path of stone pelting”?, she asked saying the Colleges are meant for studies to produce professionals and it should be duty of all right thinking people to send their wards to the educational institutions and not the “institutes of stone pelters”. “Students shouldn’t be on the roads.

As people were engaged in protest rallies in Kashmir, some miscreants took advantage of it,” she said, adding shops and houses were illegally constructed and wood from forests was being smuggled. “We have only land that is available to us where we can make projects in the future,” the CM said. She said she had heard that “huge encroachments” had taken place in Jammu region also where some people took advantage of the unrest in Kashmir “as most of Government setup is focused towards it”.

You need to focus on them and remove encroachments,” she told the civil administration. “The authorities in Jammu should take a call and ensure that the illegal constructions are removed and no fresh encroachment should come up,” Mehbooba said.	0	0	0	0

Indian security agencies believe that the absconding Haath Kata Nasirullah, who was training jihadis at Mukimnagar in Murshidabad District of West Bengal is none other than Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh military chief Sohel Mahfuz, The Times of India reports on November 22. Bangladeshi authorities have indicated that Mahfuz is the most important name on the list of 41 militants suspected to be hiding in India. Dhaka had handed over this list to India two days ago. Sources say Myanmar militant Khalid Mohammad and JMB Bengal head Sajid both of whom are in custody have confirmed that Mahfuz was posing as Nasirullah in India. Explaining how Mahfuz managed to hide in Bengal and rebuild JMB, National Investigation Agency (NIA) officers said the outfit adopted a cut out strategy, in which senior leaders are isolated from field level operatives to carry out subversive activities and attacks on heads of state. The strategy leaves JMB activists in the dark about the identities of top leaders of the outfit as they blindly carry out orders they consider part of their religious duty , say sources. As a result, when a JMB cadre is arrested, he cannot lead security agencies to anyone high up in the chain.	0	0	0	0

Replying to questions at a press conference, Radhakrishnan said the Home Department had decided to strengthen 16 Police Stations in the tribal areas, in addition to opening Jana Maithri Police Stations. The student police scheme would also be implemented in tribal schools, he said. Persons belonging to the Scheduled Tribe communities would be appointed Home Guards and be given other tasks such as monitoring the reach of Government welfare programmes and development activities.

American intelligence agency CIA has failed to eliminate more than four al Qaeda leaders in its highly costly and controversial assassination by drones campaign inside Pakistan during 2011, revealed an annual report compiled by Conflict Monitoring Centre (CMC) on drone attacks, reports Daily Times. CMC, an independent research centre, which regularly monitors drone attacks in Pakistan, has prepared an annual report (2011) on drone attacks inside Pakistani territory. The report notes 43 percent decline in drone attacks during 2011 than 2010. CIA had conducted 132 drone attacks in 2010. The number of fatalities in drone attacks has also dropped by 35 percent. US had carried out 75 drone attacks inside Pakistan during the year 2011 killing 609 people. Among them only three were Arab commanders of al Qaeda one was UKs most wanted and just four were senior commanders of different factions of Pakistani militants, the report said, adding that the rest were innocents. American drones fired 242 AGM 114 Hellfire missiles during the year and destroyed 38 houses, 37 vehicles, one camp and a seminary. One such missile costs for $68000 which means the CIA spent $16.456 million or Rs 1.5 billion to kill 609 people. In average, ammunition cost of every single casualty was $27000 or Rs 2.4 million. If other expenses are included the overall cost of killing one suspected militant will further rise. It may become point of concern for American taxpayer that such a huge amount of money was spent just to eliminate four al Qaeda leaders and four Taliban commanders. The report said drone strikes also strained US Pak relations.	0	0	0	0

A firm run by the Pakistani military will collect a fee of USD 1,000 for every container truck passing through the country under new conditions for the reopening of NATO supply routes, Indian Express reported quoting a media report of January 21. The Government is contemplating the imposition of the fee, which will be collected by the army run National Logistics Cell (NLC) as a condition for reopening the supply routes that were closed in retaliation for a cross border NATO air strike on November 26, 2011 that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. There is no proposal from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to impose a transit fee on International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and NATO containers but the Government is considering a proposal to allow the NLC to charge a fee for transportation charges and for providing No Objection Certificates, revealed the sources privy to the development. “The proposed fee is not to be imposed by the FBR despite getting approval in the Finance Bill 2011,” an unnamed senior official of the FBR said. Instead, the NLC will be tasked to collect the fee and to ensure that no pilferage of NATO supplies occurs during transit through Pakistan. The NLC currently charges a small fee for granting NOC and a proposal is being considered to raise this fee to USD1,000 per container in case NATO supplies are restored.	0	0	0	0

One of them was identified as Ruleka Khatun. About 400 fake notes of Rs 500 were seized from them, a Police officer said. Sources said the two had confessed to procuring the fake notes from an agent in Bihar. They added that the duo had been asked to give the notes to some other agents. In many cases, FICN racketeers are found to be involved in cattle smuggling and even funding militancy in the region. Investigation will reveal more details, the officer added.Usually, a consignment of FICN worth of INR 1 lakh is smuggled into the state in exchange of INR 60,000 worth of real notes, report said. Thus, when agents supply these notes to the market, they get a flat 40 cut on every lot. The couriers, after acquiring the FICNs from their counterparts in Bangladesh or Pakistan, pump them into Assam. Later, a separate batch of couriers, mostly hired on low payment, circulate them in major towns of the state like Dibrugarh, Tezpur, Bongaigaon and various parts of the Barak Valley. Earlier, Assam Police sources had hinted at the involvement of Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) linkmen in FICN rackets in the region.

He said international aid agencies were not allowed to carry out relief work because the Government had not sought their help. Mehsood said an international call by the host Government was mandatory to let foreign Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the disaster hit areas. He said the Government also did not want to have foreigners doing relief work as the law and order situation was bad in the area. MSF claimed that still there are areas where the government aid has not reached. However, a nationalist Baloch leader, who didn’t want to come on record, said there was a tacit agreement between the Government and Baloch insurgents that foreigners should not be allowed to operate in the area. “Baloch militants don’t want foreigners reaching their hideouts in the garb of humanitarian aid workers,” he said.	0	0	0	0

Moreover, according to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Bihar Police sources, Tehseen Akhtar alias Monu, said to be an aide of arrested Indian Mujahideen (IM) leader Yasin Bhatkal and suspected to be the key conspirator, was told to get youth from places other than Bihar to broad base the module. Meanwhile, investigations into the Patna serial blasts have clearly revealed that the terrorist attack was a well planned operation carried out by at least 18 IM operatives who were divided into three modules. Intelligence sources said, that Ranchi was the main centre where the conspiracy to target Narendra Modi’s Patna rally was hatched. The bombs were also assembled in Ranchi and then taken to Patna by members of the three modules. The entire operation was supervised by key IM operative Tehseen Akhtar alias Monu, and Waqas. Intelligence inputs and investigations reveal that IM terrorists wanted to carry out a “human bomb” attack at the crowded rally, but failed as this particular module lacked the expertise to put together such a sophisticated explosive. Therefore only low intensity crude explosives were used in the serial bombings.	0	0	0	0

In deeply embarrassing disclosures for Pakistan, its chief investigator of the 26 11 Mumbai terror attack (2008) has stated that the mayhem was planned and launched from this country and that the operation was directed from an ops room in Karachi (Pakistan), reports The Economic Times on August 5. Tariq Khosa, a top police officer who was made Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) weeks after the 26 11 Mumbai terror attack, has written a revealing article in Dawn newspaper giving graphic details of the plot and its investigation, thereby confirming what India has been saying for long. Khosa, who has held top posts in the Pakistan Government and Interpol besides initiating criminal investigation into former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto s assassination in 2007, wrote that Pakistan has to deal with the Mumbai mayhem, planned and launched from its soil. This requires facing the truth and admitting mistakes. He also demanded that Pakistan s state security apparatus should ensure that the perpetrators and masterminds of the ghastly terror attacks are brought to justice. Noting that the case has lingered on for far too long, Khosa said dilatory tactics by the defendants, frequent change of trial judges and assassination of the case prosecutor as well as retracting from original testimony by some key witnesses have been serious setbacks for the prosecutors. The Asian Age adds that in his article in Dawn, Khosa stated, The following facts are pertinent. First, Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani national, whose place of residence and initial schooling as well as his joining a banned militant organisation was established by the investigators. Second, the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) terrorists were imparted training near Thatta, Sindh and launched by sea from there. The training camp was identified and secured by the investigators. The casings of the explosive devices used in Mumbai were recovered from this training camp and duly matched. Third, the fishing trawler used by the terrorists for hijacking an Indian trawler in which they sailed to Mumbai, was brought back to harbour, then painted and concealed. It was recovered by the investigators and connected to the accused. Fourth, the engine of the dinghy abandoned by the terrorists near Mumbai harbour contained a patent number through which the investigators traced its import from Japan to Lahore and then to a Karachi sports shop from where a LeT linked militant purchased it along with the dinghy. The money trail was followed and linked to the accused who was arrested. Fifth, the ops room in Karachi, from where the operation was directed, was also identified and secured by the investigators. The communications through Voice over Internet Protocol were unearthed. Sixth, the alleged commander and his deputies were identified and arrested. Seventh, a couple of foreign based financiers and facilitators were arrested and brought to face trial. However, India feels that its stand is vindicated in the disclosures made by the Pakistani chief investigator of the 26 11 Mumbai attacks (2008) in a newspaper column that the terror strike was planned and launched from Pakistani soil, reports The Asian Age. Government sources said that We have always insisted that the 2008 terror attack were planned, financed and carried out by people from Pakistan. Also, it is our view that 99 per cent of the evidence in the Mumbai case is in Pakistan. They added that prosecutors in Pakistan had enough evidence against the perpetrators of the deadly attacks and that if they had revealed it the outcome of the trial would have been different, a reference to the fact that those responsible for it, including Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, are roaming free in Pakistan.	0	0	0	0

In what constitutes undeniable evidence of Pakistan s involvement in the terror attack at Dinanagar in Gurdaspur District of Punjab on July 27, the intelligence agencies have found that the Global Positioning System (GPS) sets recovered from the slain terrorists were first fed with data on July 21 at Sargodha in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, reports The Times of India. The examination of GPS sets also shows that the three terrorists were sent with instructions to kill the District Magistrate (DM) and the Superintendent of Police (SP) of Gurdaspur, attack the Dinanagar Police station and inflict mass casualties by blowing up passenger trains. Top Government sources described the data retrieved from the GPS sets as incontrovertible technical evidence of Pakistan s complicity , and expressed confidence that investigators would soon be able to determine the identity of the three attackers. The report said the GPS data shows that the masterminds had set three targets for the terrorists. The first was the Dinanagar Pathankot rail track on which five bombs were found strapped. Dinanagar Police station, where the encounter took place resulting in the terrorists being killed, was the second on the hit list. The terrorists were expected to eventually proceed to the high profile targets of bungalows of the DM and the SP in the Civil Lines area of the town for what could have been a deadly climax. Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) has emerged as the prime suspect behind July 27 terror attack in Gurdaspur in Punjab, adds The Times of India. The modus operandi was reminiscent of the storming of police stations in Jammu and Kashmir (J K), particularly the March attack carried out by LeT in Samba, while the equipment found on the three fidayeen such as GPS device, AK 47s and Chinese grenades, as well as a conscious effort on their part to conceal their identity bore the unmistakable stamp of a Lashkar operation. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) s initial assessment is that the terrorists may have infiltrated from across Pakistan into Kathua, which borders Dinanagar, the site of the attack. It is likely that they were headed for a fidayeen operation in Jammu region, but given the tight security there in the wake of intelligence inputs on LeT s plans to push in two groups of infiltrators into Kathua, they may have found it easier to target an adjoining location in Punjab, a senior Home Ministry official said. The modus operandi terrorists dressed in military fatigues, early morning strike, car jacking, indiscriminate firing and storming of a police station followed by engaging security forces in an encounter had all the elements associated with a typical LeT attack, the official added. UMHA on July 28 claimed that the attack led by three terrorists at Dinanagar Police station in Gurdaspur was a desperate bid by Pakistan s intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to revive militancy in Punjab, reports Mumbai Mirror. Last week Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) and Chief Secretary were called for a meeting to apprise them of intelligence reports that ISI is making all possible efforts to regroup separatist forces within the state. The Khalistan movement is all but over. Our reports suggested that ISI was making all possible efforts to cajole few remnant separatists but found no support. Their request for logistic support for their men was also not heard. Which is why we believe they sent three fidayeen, a senior MHA official said.	0	0	0	0
